    "prompt": "Create a flowchart diagram showing how Chain-of-Thought reasoning emerges in transformers without explicit prompting.\n\nInclude these key elements:\n- Input layer: Problem statement\n- Hidden layers progression: Show how reasoning patterns emerge\n- Attention mechanisms: Highlight how attention focuses on relevant intermediate steps\n- Emergent CoT: Demonstrate spontaneous step-by-step reasoning\n- Output layer: Final answer with derived reasoning\n\nUse a clean, modern design with blue and purple color scheme. Show the flow from input through transformer layers where reasoning emerges naturally."
