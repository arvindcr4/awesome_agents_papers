**Title:** ReMax: A Simple, Effective, and Efficient Reinforcement Learning Method for Aligning Large Language Models
**Research Method:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**Method Description:** ReMax is a reinforcement learning method designed for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. It leverages three properties of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) tasks: fast simulation, deterministic transitions, and trajectory-level rewards. ReMax builds upon the REINFORCE algorithm and introduces a new variance reduction technique using a greedy baseline value. This approach simplifies implementation, reduces memory usage, minimizes hyper-parameters, speeds up training, and improves task performance.
**Key Contributions:**
* ReMax is a simple, effective, and efficient reinforcement learning method for aligning LLMs.
* It leverages the properties of RLHF tasks to reduce computational load and improve performance.
* ReMax outperforms Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in terms of simplicity, memory efficiency, and computation efficiency.
* It achieves comparable performance to PPO in terms of reward maximization.
* ReMax can be used for weakly supervised learning and can fine-tune LLMs with arbitrary reward models on various prompt datasets.
