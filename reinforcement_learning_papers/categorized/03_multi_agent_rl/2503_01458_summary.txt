**TITLE:** SrSv: Integrating Sequential Rollouts with Sequential Value Estimation for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2503.01458v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** SrSv is a novel framework that integrates sequential rollouts with sequential value estimation for multi-agent reinforcement learning. It aims to capture agent interdependence and provide a scalable solution for cooperative MARL. SrSv leverages the autoregressive property of the Transformer model to handle varying populations through sequential action rollout.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces a novel framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that integrates sequential rollouts with sequential value estimation
* Provides a scalable solution for cooperative MARL
* Demonstrates superior performance in training efficiency and scalability compared to baseline methods
* Shows excellent scalability in large-scale systems with up to 1024 agents
* Provides a detailed ablation study to investigate the impact of different components on the performance of SrSv
