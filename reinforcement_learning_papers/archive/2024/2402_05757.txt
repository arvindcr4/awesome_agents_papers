ABSTRACT
Mean-field reinforcement learning has become a popular theoretical
framework for efficiently approximating large-scale multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) problems exhibiting symmetry.
However, questions remain regarding the applicability of meanfield approximations: in particular, their approximation accuracy
of real-world systems and conditions under which they become
computationally tractable. We establish explicit finite-agent bounds
for how well the MFG solution approximates the true 𝑁 -player
game for two popular mean-field solution concepts. Furthermore,
for the first time, we establish explicit lower bounds indicating that
MFGs are poor or uninformative at approximating 𝑁 -player games
assuming only Lipschitz dynamics and rewards. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity of solving MFGs with only Lipschitz
properties and prove that they are in the class of PPAD-complete
problems conjectured to be intractable, similar to general sum 𝑁
player games. Our theoretical results underscore the limitations
of MFGs and complement and justify existing work by proving
difficulty in the absence of common theoretical assumptions.

in for instance auctions [17], and cloud resource management [21].
For the mean-field analysis, the game dynamics with 𝑁 -players
must be symmetric (i.e., each player must be exposed to the same
rules) and anonymous (i.e., the effect of each player on the others
should be permutation invariant). Under this simplification, works
such as [1, 6, 12, 25, 27, 35, 36] and many others have analyzed
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the MFG limit 𝑁 → ∞
to obtain a tractable approximation of many agent games, providing
learning guarantees under various structural assumptions.
Being a simplification, MFG formulations should ideally satisfy
two desiderata: (1) they should be relevant, i.e., they are good approximations of the original MARL problem and (2) they should be
tractable, i.e., they are at least easier than solving the original MARL
problem. In this work, we would like to understand the extent to
which MFGs satisfy these two requirements, and we aim to answer
two natural questions that remain understudied:
• When are MFGs good approximations of the finite player
games, when are they not? In particular, are polynomially
many agents always sufficient for mean-field approximation
to be effective?
• Is solving MFGs always computationally tractable, or more
tractable than directly solving the 𝑁 -player game? In particular, can MFGs be solved in polynomial or pseudo-polynomial
time?

INTRODUCTION

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) finds numerous impactful applications in the real world [21, 22, 28, 31, 32, 34]. Despite
the urgent need in practice, MARL remains a fundamental challenge, especially in the setting with large numbers of agents due to
the so-called “curse of many agents” [33].
Mean-field games (MFG), a theoretical framework first proposed
by Lasry and Lions [19] and Huang et al. [16], permits the theoretical study of such large-scale games by introducing mean-field
simplification. Under certain assumptions, the mean-field approximation leads to efficient algorithms for the analysis of a particular
type of 𝑁 -agent competitive game where there are symmetries
between players and when 𝑁 is large. Such games appear widely

Related Work

Mean-field RL has been studied in various mathematical settings.
In this work, we focus on two popular formulations in particular:
stationary mean-field games (Stat-MFG, see e.g. [1, 12]) and finitehorizon MFG (FH-MFG, see e.g. [25, 27]). In the Stat-MFG setting
the objective is to find a stationary policy that is optimal with
respect to its induced stationary distribution, while in the FH-MFG
setting, a finite-horizon reward is considered with a time-varying
policy and population distribution.
Existing results on MFG relevance/approximation. The approximation properties of MFGs have been explored by several
works in literature, as summarized in Table 1. Finite-agent approximation bounds have been widely analyzed in the case of stochastic
mean-field differential games [3, 4], albeit in the differential setting
and without explicit lower bounds. Recent works [1, 6] have established that Stat-MFG Nash equilibria (Stat-MFG-NE) asymptotically
approximate the NE of 𝑁 -player symmetric dynamic games under
continuity assumptions. The result by Saldi et al. [30], as the basis
of subsequent proofs, shows asymptotic convergence for a large
class of MFG variants and only requires continuity of dynamics
and rewards as well as minor technical assumptions such as compactness and a form of local Lipschitz continuity. However, such

asymptotic convergence guarantees leave the question unanswered
if the MFG models are realistic in real-world games. Many games
such as traffic systems, financial markets, etc. naturally exhibit large
𝑁 , however, if 𝑁 must be astronomically large for good approximation, the real-world impact of the mean-field analysis will be
limited. Recently, [37] provided finite-agent approximation bounds
of a special class of stateless MFG, which assumes no state dynamics. We complement existing work on approximation properties of
both Stat-MFG and FH-MFG by providing explicit upper and lower
bounds for approximation.
Existing results on MFG tractability. The tractability of solving MFGs as a proxy for MARL has been also heavily studied in
the RL community under various classes of structural assumptions.
Since finding approximate Nash equilibria for normal form games is
PPAD-complete, a class believed to be computationally intractable
[5, 7], solving the mean-field approximation in many cases can be a
tractable alternative. We summarize recent work for computationally (or statistically) solving the two types of MFGs below, with an
in-depth comparison also provided in Table 2.
For Stat-MFG, under a contraction assumption RL algorithms
such as Q-learning [1, 38], policy mirror ascent [36], policy gradient methods [13], soft Q-learning [6] and fictitious play [35] have
been shown to solve Stat-MFG with statistical and computational
efficiency. However, all of these guarantees require the game to
be heavily regularized as pointed out in [6, 36], inducing a nonvanishing bias on the computed Nash. Moreover, in some works the
population evolution is also implicitly required to be contractive
under all policies (see e.g. [12, 36]), further restricting the analysis
to sufficiently smooth games. While [14] has proposed a method
that guarantees convergence to MFG-NE under differentiable dynamics, the algorithm converges only when initialized sufficiently
close to the solution. To the best of our knowledge, there are neither
RL algorithms that work without regularization nor evidence of difficulty in the absence of such strong assumptions: we complement
the line of work by showing that unless dynamics are sufficiently
smooth, Stat-MFG is both computationally intractable and a poor
approximation.
A separate line of work analyzes the finite horizon problem. In
this case, when the dynamics are population-independent and the
payoffs are monotone the problem is known to be tractable. Algorithms such as fictitious play [27] and mirror descent [25] have
been shown to converge to Nash in corresponding continuoustime equations. Recent work has also focused on the statistical
complexity of the finite-horizon problem in very general FH-MFG
problems [15], however, the algorithm proposed is in general computationally intractable. In terms of computational tractability and
the approximation properties, our work complements these results
by demonstrating that (1) when dynamics depend on the population
as well an exponential approximation lower bound exists, and (2)
in the absence of monotonicity, the FH-MFG is provably as difficult
as solving an 𝑁 -player game.
Finally, we note that there are several other settings and MFG
solution concepts have been analyzed. For instance, a certain class
of infinite horizon MFG has been shown to be equivalent to concave
utility RL, proving finite-time computational guarantees [10].

Our Contribution

In this work, we formalize and provide answers to the two aforementioned fundamental questions, first focusing on the approximation
properties of MFG in Section 3 and later on the computational
tractability of MFG in Section 4. Our contributions are summarized
as follows.
Firstly, we introduce explicit finite-agent approximation bounds
for finite horizon and stationary MFGs (Table 1) in terms of exploitability in the finite agent game. In both cases, we prove explicit
upper bounds which quantify how many agents a symmetric game
must have to be well-approximated by the MFG, which has been
absent in the literature to the best of our knowledge. Our approximation results only require a minimal Lipschitz continuity assumption
of the transition
 kernel and rewards. For FH-MFG, we prove a
O

(1−𝐿𝐻 )𝐻 2
√
(1−𝐿) 𝑁

upper bound for the exploitabilty where 𝐿 is the

Lipschitz modulus of the population evolution operator: the upper
bound exhibits an exponential dependence
 on the horizon 𝐻 . For

(1−𝛾 ) −3

√
the Stat-MFG we show that a O
approximation bound
𝑁
can be established, but only if the population evolution dynamics
are non-expansive. Next, for the first time, we establish explicit
lower bounds for the approximation proving the shortcomings of
the upper bounds are fundamental. For the FH-MFG, we show that
unless 𝑁 ≥ Ω(2𝐻 ), an exploitability linear in horizon 𝐻 is unavoidable when deploying the MFG solution to the 𝑁 player game:
hence in general the MFG equilibrium becomes irrelevant quickly
as the problem horizon increases. For Stat-MFG we establish an
Ω(𝑁 log2 𝛾 ) lower bound when the population dynamics are not
restricted to non-expansive population operators, showing that a
large discount factor 𝛾 also rapidly deteriorates the approximation
efficiency. Our lower bounds indicate that in the worst case, the
number of agents required for the approximation can grow exponentially in the problem parameters, demonstrating the limitations
of the MFG approximation.
Finally, from the computational perspective, we establish that
both finite-horizon and stationary MFGs can be PPAD-complete
problems in general, even when restricted to certain simple subclasses (Table 2). This shows that both MFG problems are in general
as hard as finding a Nash equilibrium of 𝑁 -player general sum
games. Furthermore, our results imply that unless PPAD=P there
are no polynomial time algorithms for solving FH-MFG and StatMFG, a result indicating computational intractability.

been replaced by 𝜋 ′ . For any 𝑁 ∈ N ≥0 , [𝑁 ] := {1, . . . , 𝑁 }.
MFGs introduce a dependence on the population distribution
over states of the rewards and dynamics. We will strictly consider
Lipschitz continuous rewards and dynamics, which is a common
assumption in literature [1, 12, 35, 36], formalized below.

Definition 2.1 (Lipschitz dynamics, rewards). For some 𝐿 ≥ 0, we
define the set of 𝐿-Lipschitz reward functions and state transition
dynamics as
n
R𝐿 := 𝑅 : S × A × Δ S →[0, 1] : |𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) − 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ′ )|
o
≤ 𝐿∥𝜇 − 𝜇 ′ ∥ 1, ∀𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇, 𝜇 ′ ,
n
P𝐿 := 𝑃 : S × A × Δ S →Δ S : ∥𝑃 (𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) − 𝑃 (𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ′ )∥ 1
o
≤ 𝐿∥𝜇 − 𝜇 ′ ∥ 1, ∀𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇, 𝜇 ′ .
Moreover, we define the set of Lipschitz rewards and dynamics as
Ð
Ð
R := 𝐿≥0 R𝐿 , P := 𝐿≥0 P𝐿 respectively.

We note that there are interesting MFGs with non-Lipschitz dynamics and rewards, however, even the existence of Nash is not
guaranteed in this case. Lipschitz continuity is a minimal assumption under which solutions to MFG always exist, and as our aim is
to prove lower bounds and difficulty we will adopt this assumption.
Solving MFG with non-Lipschitz dynamics is more challenging
than Lipschitz continuous MFG (the latter being a subset of the
former), hence our difficulty results will apply.
Operators. We will define the useful population operators Γ𝑃 :
𝐻
Δ S × Π → Δ S , Γ𝑃𝐻 : Δ S × Π → Δ S , and Λ𝐻
𝑃 : Δ S × Π𝐻 → Δ S as
∑︁
Γ𝑃 (𝜇, 𝜋) :=
𝜇 (𝑠)𝜋 (𝑎|𝑠)𝑃 (·|𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇),

𝐻 −1 ∈ Π , 𝑃 ∈ P, 𝜇 ∈ Δ .

Finally, we will need the following Lipschitz continuity result
for the Γ𝑃 operator.
Lemma 2.2. [36, Lemma 3.2] Let 𝑃 ∈ P𝐾𝜇 for 𝐾𝜇 > 0 and
𝐾𝑠 := sup 𝑃 (𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ) − 𝑃 (𝑠 ′ , 𝑎, 𝜇 ) 1 , 𝐾𝑎 := sup 𝑃 (𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ) − 𝑃 (𝑠, 𝑎 ′ , 𝜇 ) 1 .
𝑠,𝑠 ′
𝑎,𝜇

𝑎,𝑎 ′
𝑠,𝜇

Then it holds for all 𝜇, 𝜇 ′ ∈ Δ S , 𝜋, 𝜋 ′ ∈ Π that:
∥Γ𝑃 (𝜇, 𝜋) − Γ𝑃 (𝜇 ′, 𝜋 ′ )∥ 1 ≤ 𝐿𝑝𝑜𝑝,𝜇 ∥𝜇 − 𝜇 ′ ∥ 1 +

𝐾𝑎
∥𝜋 − 𝜋 ′ ∥ 1,
2

where 𝐿𝑝𝑜𝑝,𝜇 := (𝐾𝜇 + 𝐾2𝑠 + 𝐾2𝑎 ) for all 𝜋, 𝜋 ′ ∈ Π, 𝜇, 𝜇 ′ ∈ Δ S .
In particular, in our settings, Lemma 2.2 indicates that Γ𝑃 is
always Lipschitz continuous if 𝑃 ∈ P, a property which will become
significant for approximation analysis.
We will be interested in two classes of MFG solution concepts
that lead to different analyses: infinite horizon stationary MFG
Nash equilibrium (Stat-MFG-NE) and finite horizon MFG Nash
equilibrium (FH-MFG-NE). The first problem widely studied in literature is the stationary MFG equilibrium problem, see for instance
[1, 12, 13, 35, 36]. We formalize this solution concept below.
Definition 2.3 (Stat-MFG). A stationary MFG (Stat-MFG) is defined by the tuple (S, A, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝛾) for Lipschitz dynamics and rewards
𝑃 ∈ P, 𝑅 ∈ R, discount factor 𝛾 ∈ (0, 1). For any (𝜇, 𝜋) ∈ Δ S × Π,
we define the 𝛾-discounted infinite horizon expected reward as

Approximation Analysis of FH-MFG

Firstly, we define the finite-player game that is approximately solved
by the FH-MFG-NE.
Definition 3.1 (𝑁 -FH-SAG). An 𝑁 -player finite horizon SAG
(𝑁 -FH-SAG) is determined by the tuple (𝑁 , S, A, 𝐻, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝜇0 ) such
that 𝑁 ∈ Z>0, 𝐻 ∈ Z>0 , 𝑃 ∈ P, 𝑅 ∈ R, 𝜇0 ∈ Δ S . For any 𝜋 =
𝑁 , we define the expected mean reward

The second MFG concept that we will consider has a finite time
horizon, and is also common in literature [15, 20, 26, 27]. In this
case, the population distribution is permitted to vary over time,
and the objective is to find an optimal non-stationary policy with
respect to the population distribution it induces. We formalize this
problem and the corresponding solution concept below.
Definition 2.4 (FH-MFG). A finite horizon MFG problem (FHMFG) is determined by the tuple (S, A, 𝐻, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝜇0 ) where 𝐻 ∈ Z>0 ,
𝐻 ∈ Π , 𝝁 = {𝜇 }𝐻 −1 ∈

As established in literature, the reason the FH-MFG and Stat-MFG
problems are studied is the fact that they can approximate the NE
of certain symmetric games with 𝑁 players, establishing the main
relevance of the formulations in the real world. Such results are
summarized in Table 1.
In this section, we study how efficient this convergence is and
also related lower bounds. For these purposes, we first define the
corresponding finite-player game of each mean-field game problem: to avoid confusion, we call these games symmetric anonymous
dynamic games (SAG). Afterwards, for each solution concept, we
will first establish (1) an upper bound on the approximation error
(i.e. the exploitability) due to the mean-field, and (2) a lower bound
demonstrating the worst-case rate. We will present the main outlines of proofs, and postpone computation-intensive derivations to
the supplementary material of the paper.

𝐻,𝑁 ,(𝑖 )

If instead E𝑃,𝑅
(𝜋 ) ≤ 𝛿 for all 𝑖, then 𝜋 is called a 𝛿-𝑁 -FH-SAG
Nash equilibrium.
The above definition corresponds to a real-world problem as the
𝐻,𝑁 ,(𝑖 )
function 𝐽𝑃,𝑅
expresses the expected total payoff of each player:
hence a 𝛿-𝑁 -MFG-NE is a Nash equilibrium of a concrete 𝑁 -player
game in the traditional game theoretical sense. Also, note that now
in the definition transition probabilities and rewards depend on
b
𝜇ℎ which is the F ({𝑠ℎ𝑖 }𝑖 ) = Fℎ -measurable random vector of the
empirical state distribution at time ℎ of all agents.
Firstly, we provide a positive result well-known in literature:
the 𝑁 -FH-SAG is approximately solved by the FH-MFG-NE policy.
Unlike some past works, we establish an explicit rate of convergence
in terms of 𝑁 and problem parameters.
Theorem 3.2 (Approximation of 𝑁 -FH-SAG). Let (S, A, 𝐻, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝜇0 )

and A = {𝑎 A, 𝑎 B }. We define the initial state distribution with
𝝁 0 (𝑠 Left ) = 𝝁 0 (𝑠 Right ) = 1/2. The colored state transition probabilities are given by the function:

exponential dependence on the Lipschitz constant of the operator
Γ𝑃 . However, for games with longer horizons, the upper bound
might require an unrealistic amount of agents 𝑁 to guarantee a
good approximation due to the exponential dependency. Next, we
establish a worst-case result demonstrating that this is not avoidable
without additional assumptions.

until time 𝐾 := log5 𝑁 . Moreover, with a series of concentration bounds, it can be shown that within an expected number of
O (log 𝑁 ) steps, all agents will converge to either 𝑠 Left or 𝑠 Right during even rounds. Only the colored transitions are defined to have
non-zero rewards, whose definition (provided in the supplementary) guarantees that the exploitability suffered scales linearly with
𝐻 after 𝑁 agents concentrate on the same state in even steps. □
This result shows that without further assumptions, the FH-MFG
solution might suffer from exponential exploitability in 𝐻 in the
𝑁 -player game. In such cases, to avoid the concrete 𝑁 -player game
from deviating from the mean-field behavior too fast, either 𝐻 must
be small or 𝑃 must be sufficiently smooth in 𝜇. We note that the
typical assumption in the finite-horizon setting that 𝑃 ∈ P0 (see
e.g. [10, 27]) avoids this lower bound since in this case Γ𝑃 (·, 𝜋)
is simply multiplication by a stochastic matrix which is always
non-expansive (𝐿 = 1). We also note at the expense of simplicity
a stronger counter-example inducing exploitability Ω(𝐻 ) unless
𝑁 ≥ Ω((𝐿 − 𝜖) 𝐻 ) for all 𝜖 > 0 can be constructed, where 𝑃 ∈ P𝐿 .
A remark. The proof of Theorem 3.3 in fact suggests that for
finite 𝑁 and large horizon 𝐻 , there exists a time-homogenous policy

Approximation Analysis of Stat-MFG

Similarly, we introduce the 𝑁 -player game corresponding to the
Stat-MFG solution concept.
Definition 3.4 (𝑁 -Stat-SAG). An 𝑁 -player stationary SAG (𝑁 Stat-SAG) problem is defined by the tuple (𝑁 , S, A, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝛾) for Lipschitz dynamics and rewards 𝑃 ∈ P, 𝑅 ∈ R, discount factor 𝛾 ∈ (0, 1).
For any (𝜇, 𝜋 ) ∈ Δ S × Π 𝑁 , the 𝑁 -player 𝛾-discounted infinite horizon expected reward is defined as:

□

The result above shows that unless the relevant Γ𝑃 operator is
contracting in some potential, in general, the exploitability of the
Stat-MFG-NE in the 𝑁 -player game might be very large unless
the effective horizon (1 − 𝛾) −1 is small. Hence, in these cases, the
mean-field Nash equilibrium might be uninformative regarding the
true NE of the 𝑁 player game. In the case of Stat-MFG, our lower
bound is even stronger in the sense that the exploitability no longer
√
decreases with O ( 1/ 𝑁 ) for large 𝛾. For a sufficiently long effective
−1
horizon (1 − 𝛾) and large enough Lipschitz constant 𝐿, the rate
in terms of 𝑁 can be arbitrarily slow. Furthermore, if we take the
ergodic limit 𝛾 → 1, we will observe a non-vanishing exploitability
Ω(1) for all finite 𝑁 .

A note on simple functions. We define simple functions as
above as in general there is no known efficient encoding of a Lipschitz continuous function as a sequence of bits. This is significant since a Turing machine accepts a finite sequence of bits as
input. To solve this issue, we prove a slightly stronger hardness
result that even games where 𝑃 (𝑠 ′ |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇), 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) are Lipschitz
functions with strong structure are PPAD-complete. Since we are
proving hardness, other larger classes of 𝑃, 𝑅 including P Sim, R Sim
will have similar intractability. See also arithmetic circuits with
max, min gates [9] for a similar idea.

4.1

The Complexity Class PPAD

The PPAD class is defined by the complete problem End-of-TheLine [7], whose formal definition we defer to the appendix as it is
not used in our proofs.
Definition 4.2 (PPAD, PPAD-hard, PPAD-complete). The class PPAD
is defined as all search problems that can be reduced to End-ofThe-Line in polynomial time. If End-of-The-Line can be reduced
to a search problem S in polynomial time, then S is called PPADhard. A search problem S is called PPAD-complete if it is both a
member of PPAD and it is PPAD-hard.
While End-of-the-Line defines the problem class PPAD, it is
hard to construct direct reductions to it. We will instead use two
problems that are known to be PPAD-complete (and hence can be
equivalently used to define PPAD): solving generalized circuits and
finding a NE for an 𝑁 -player general sum game.
Definition 4.3 (Generalized Circuits [8, 29]). A generalized circuit C = (V, G) is a finite set of nodes V and gates G. Each
gate 𝐺 ∈ G is characterized by the tuple 𝐺 (𝜃 |𝑣 1, 𝑣 2 |𝑣) where 𝐺 ∈
{𝐺 ←, 𝐺 ×,+, G< }, 𝜃 ∈ R★ is a parameter (possibly of length 0),
𝑣 1, 𝑣 2 ∈ 𝑉 ∪ {⊥} are the input nodes (with ⊥ indicating an empty input) and 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 it the output node of the gate. The collection of gates
G satisfies the property that if 𝐺 1 (𝜃 |𝑣 1, 𝑣 2 |𝑣), 𝐺 2 (𝜃 ′ |𝑣 1′ , 𝑣 2′ |𝑣 ′ ) ∈ 𝐺
are distinct gates, then 𝑣 ≠ 𝑣 ′ .
Such circuits define a set of constraints on values assigned to
each gate, and finding such an assignment will be the associated
computational problem for such a circuit desription. We formally
define the 𝜀-GCircuit problem to this end. 𝜀-GCircuit is a standard
complete problem for the class PPAD, and we will work with it for
our reductions. We will use the shorthand notation 𝑥 = 𝑦 ± 𝜀 to
indicate that 𝑥 ∈ [𝑦 − 𝜀, 𝑦 + 𝜀] for 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ R.
Definition 4.4 (𝜀-GCircuit [29]). Given a generalized circuit C =
(V, G), a function 𝑝 : 𝑉 → [0, 1] is called an 𝜀-satisfying assignment if:
• For every gate 𝐺 ∈ G of the form 𝐺 ← (𝜁 ||𝑣) for 𝜁 ∈ 0, 1, it
holds that 𝑝 (𝑣) = 𝜁 ± 𝜀,
• For every gate 𝐺 ∈ G of the form 𝐺 ×,+ (𝛼, 𝛽 |𝑣 1, 𝑣 2 |𝑣) for
𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ [−1, 1], it holds that
𝑝 (𝑣) ∈ [max{min{0, 𝛼𝑝 (𝑣 1 ) + 𝛽𝑝 (𝑣 2 )}}] ± 𝜀,
• For every gate 𝐺 ∈ G of the form 𝐺 < (|𝑣 1, 𝑣 1 |𝑣) it holds that
(
1 ± 𝜀, 𝑝 (𝑣 1 ) ≤ 𝑝 (𝑣 2 ) − 𝜀,
𝑝 (𝑣) =
0 ± 𝜀, 𝑝 (𝑣 1 ) ≥ 𝑝 (𝑣 2 ) + 𝜀.

The 𝜀-GCircuit problem is defined as follows:
Given generalized circuit C, find an 𝜀-satisfying assignment of C.
𝜀-GCircuit is one of the prototypical hard instances of PPAD
problems as the result below suggests.
Theorem 4.5. [29] There exists 𝜀 > 0 such that 𝜀-GCircuit is
PPAD-complete.
In other words, 𝜀-GCircuit is representative of the most difficult
problem in PPAD which suggests intractability. The 𝜀-GCircuit
computational problem will be used in our proofs by reducing an
arbitrary generalized circuit into solving a particular MFG.
We will also use the general sum 2-player Nash computation
problem, which is the standard problem of finding an approximate
Nash equilibrium of a general sum bimatrix game.
Definition 4.6 (2-Nash). Given 𝜀 > 0, 𝐾1, 𝐾2 ∈ N>0 , payoff matrices 𝐴, 𝐵 ∈ [0, 1] 𝐾1 ,𝐾2 , find an approximate Nash equilibrium

The following is the well-known result that even the 2-Nash general sum problem is PPAD-complete. In fact, any 𝑁 -player general
sum normal form game is PPAD-complete.
Theorem 4.7. [5] 2-Nash is PPAD-complete.

4.2

Complexity of Stat-MFG

Next, we provide our difficulty results for the Stat-MFG problem.
Notably, for Stat-MFG, the stability subproblem of finding a stable
distribution for a fixed policy 𝜋 itself is PPAD-hard. Even without
considering the optimality conditions, finding a stable distribution
in general for a fixed policy is intractable, unless additional assumptions are introduced (e.g. Γ𝑃 is contractive or non-expansive). We
define the computational problem below and state the results.
Definition 4.8 (𝜀-StatDist). Given finite state-action sets S, A,
simple dynamics 𝑃 ∈ P Sim and policy 𝜋, find 𝜇 ∗ ∈ Δ S such that
∥Γ𝑃 (𝜇 ∗, 𝜋) − 𝜇 ∗ ∥ ∞ ≤ | S𝜀 | .
The computational problem as described above is to find an approximate fixed point of Γ𝑃 (·, 𝜋) which corresponds to an approximately stable distribution of policy 𝜋. We show that 𝜀-StatDist is
PPAD-complete for some fixed constant 𝜀.
Theorem 4.9 (𝜀-StatDist is PPAD-complete). For some 𝜀 > 0,
the problem 𝜀-StatDist is PPAD-complete.
Proof. (sketch) The reduction from 𝜀-StatDist to a fixed point
problem (or the Sperner problem [7]) is straightforward, showing
𝜀-StatDist is in PPAD. The main challenge of the proof is showing 𝜀-StatDist is simultaneously PPAD-hard. This is achieved by
showing any 𝜀-GCircuit problem can be reduced to a 𝜀-StatDist
for some 𝜀 ′ . For simplicity, we reduce 𝜀-GCircuit to finding the
stable distribution of a transition kernel 𝑃 (𝑠 ′ |𝑠, 𝜇). Given a generalized circuit C = (V, G), we construct a Stat-MFG that has one

base state 𝑠 base , one additional state 𝑠 𝑣 for each 𝑣 ∈ V that is the
1 , 𝐵 := 1 . Also define the function
output of a gate. Let 𝜃 := 8𝑉
4
𝑢𝛼 (𝑥) := max{0, min{𝛼, 𝑥 }} for any 𝛼 ∈ [0, 1]. We present the construction and defer the analysis to the appendix: any gate of the
form 𝐺 ← (𝜁 ||𝑣), we will add one state 𝑠 𝑣 such that 𝑃 (𝑠 base |𝑠 𝑣 , 𝜇) = 1,
𝜁𝜃
𝑃 (𝑠 𝑣 |𝑠 base, 𝜇) = max{𝐵, 𝜇 (𝑠 ) } . For any weighted addition gate
base
𝐺 ×,+ (𝛼, 𝛽 |𝑣 1, 𝑣 2 |𝑣), we add a state 𝑠 𝑣 such that 𝑃 (𝑠 base |𝑠 𝑣 , 𝜇) = 1
𝑢 (𝛼 𝜇 (𝑣 )+𝛽𝜇 (𝑣 ) )
and 𝑃 (𝑠 𝑣 |𝑠 base, 𝜇) = 𝜃max{𝐵,1𝜇 (𝑠 )2} . Finally, for each comparibase
son gate 𝐺 < (|𝑣 1, 𝑣 1 |𝑣), also add a state 𝑠 𝑣 and define the transition
probabilities:
𝑃 (𝑠 𝑣 |𝑠 base, 𝜇) =

𝜃𝑝𝜀/8 (𝜃 −1 𝜇 (𝑠 1 ), 𝜃 −1 𝜇 (𝑠 2 ))

max{𝐵, 𝜇 (𝑠 base )}



where 𝑝𝜀 (𝑥, 𝑦) := 𝑢 1 12 + 𝜀 −1 (𝑥 − 𝑦) . Once all gates are added,
the construction is completed by defining 𝑃 (𝑠 base |𝑠 base, 𝜇) = 1 −
Í
′
𝑠 ′ ∈ S 𝑃 (𝑠 |𝑠 base , 𝜇). Simple computation verifies that for any exact
stationary distribution 𝜇 ∗ of the above 𝑃, an exact assignment the
𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 )
the generalized circuit can be read by the map 𝑣 → 𝑢 1 ( 𝜃 𝑣 ). □
As a corollary, there is no polynomial time algorithm for 𝜀StatDist unless PPAD=P, which is conjectured to be not the case.
Corollary 4.10. There exists a 𝜀 > 0 such that there exists no
polynomial time algorithm for 𝜀-StatDist, unless P = PPAD.
Most notably, these results show that the stable distribution
oracle of [6] might be intractable to compute in general, and the
shared assumption that Γ𝑃 (·, 𝜋) is contractive in some norm found
in many works [1, 35, 36] might not be trivial to remove without
sacrificing tractability.

4.3

Complexity of FH-MFG

We will show that finding an 𝜀 solution to the finite horizon problem
is also PPAD-complete, in particular even if we restrict our attention
to the case when 𝐻 = 2 and the transition probabilities 𝑃 do not
depend on 𝜇. We formalize the structured computational FH-MFG
problem.
Definition 4.11 ((𝜀, 𝐻 )-FH-Nash). Given simple reward function
𝑅 ∈ R Sim , transition matrix 𝑃 (𝑠 ′ |𝑠, 𝑎), and initial distribution 𝜇 0 ∈
𝐻 −1 such that E 𝐻 ({𝜋 }𝐻 −1 ) ≤
Δ S , find a time dependent policy {𝜋ℎ }ℎ=0
ℎ ℎ=0
𝑃,𝑅
𝜀/|S| .
Our result in the case of the finite horizon MFG problem is that
even in the case of 𝐻 = 2, the problem is PPAD-complete.
Theorem 4.12 ((𝜀, 2)-FH-Nash is PPAD-complete). There exists
an 𝜀 > 0 such that the problem (𝜀, 2)-FH-Nash is PPAD-complete.
Proof. (sketch) Once again, showing (𝜀, 2)-FH-Nash is in PPAD
is simple: it follows from the fact that a FH-MFG-NE is a fixed
point of an easy-to-compute function (see e.g. [15]). To show that
(𝜀, 2)-FH-Nash is also PPAD-hard, for an arbitrary generalized
circuit C = (V, G) we construct a FH-MFG whose 𝛿-NE will be
𝛿 ′ -satisfying assignments for C for some 𝛿’.
□

These results for the FH-MFG show that the (weak) monotonicity
assumption present in works such as [25, 27] might also be necessary, as in the absence of any structural assumptions the problems
are provably difficult.
Finally, we also show that even if 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) is a linear function
of 𝜇 for all 𝑠, 𝑎 (that is, 𝑅 ∈ R Lin ), the intractability holds, although
not for fixed 𝜀. We define the linear computational problem below.
Definition 4.14 (𝐻 -FH-Linear). Given 𝜀 > 0, linear reward function 𝑅 ∈ R Lin , transition matrix 𝑃 (𝑠 ′ |𝑠, 𝑎), find a time dependent
𝐻 −1 such that E 𝐻 ({𝜋 }𝐻 −1 ) ≤ 𝜀.

𝑃,𝑅
Theorem 4.15 (2-FH-Linear is PPAD-complete). The problem
2-FH-Linear is PPAD-complete.
Proof. (sketch) In this case, we provide a reduction from 2Nash. For a given 2-Nash instance 𝐾1, 𝐾2 ∈ N>0 with payoff matrices 𝐴, 𝐵 ∈ [0, 1] 𝐾1 ,𝐾2 , we construct an FH-MFG with one initial
state for each player and one additional state for each strategy
of each of the players, resulting in a FH-MFG with 𝐾1 + 𝐾2 + 2
1 , 𝑠 2 , 𝑠 1 , . . . , 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 , . . . , 𝑠 2 }. We set 𝜇 (𝑠 1 ) =
states, S := {𝑠 base

In the first round, an agent starting from 𝑠 base

will tran2

sition to one of states 𝑠 1 , . . . , 𝑠𝐾 . In the second round, the agent
2
will receive a population-dependent reward regardless of the action
player, which is equal to the expected utility of an action (a linear
function). We postpone the cumbersome details relating to error
analysis and dealing with the case 𝐾1 ≠ 𝐾2 to the appendix.
□
We emphasize that for 2-FH-Linear the accuracy 𝜀 is also an
input of the problem: hence the existence of a pseudo-polynomial
time algorithm is not ruled out.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We provided novel results on when mean-field RL is relevant for
real-world applications and when it is tractable from a computational perspective. Our results differ from existing work by provably
characterizing cases where MFGs might have practical shortcomings. From the approximation perspective, we show clear conditions
and lower bounds on when the MFGs efficiently approximate realworld games. Computationally, we show that even simple MFGs
can be as hard as solving 𝑁 -player general sum games.
We emphasize that our results do not discard MFGs, but rather
identify potential bottlenecks (and conditions to overcome these)
when using mean-field RL to compute a good approximate NE.

It is easy to show that if 𝜉 ∈ 𝑆𝐺 (𝜎 2 ), then 𝛼𝜉 ∈ 𝑆𝐺 (𝛼 2 𝜎 2 ) for any
constant 𝛼 ∈ R. Furthermore, if 𝜉 1, . . . , 𝜉𝑛 are independent random

variables with 𝜉𝑖 ∈ 𝑆𝐺 (𝜎𝑖2 ), then 𝑖 𝜉𝑖 ∈ 𝑆𝐺 ( 𝑖 𝜎𝑖2 ). Finally, if
𝜉 is almost surely bounded in [𝑎, 𝑏], then 𝜉𝑖 ∈ 𝑆𝐺 ( (𝑏 − 𝑎) 2/4). We
also state the well-known Hoeffding concentration bound and a
corollary, Lemma A.3.
Lemma A.2 (Hoeffding ineqality [23]). Let 𝜉 ∈ 𝑆𝐺 (𝜎 2 ). Then

□
Finally, we prove slightly more general upper bounds than presented in the main text that approximates the exploitability of an
approximate MFG-NE in a finite population setting. Hence we define
the following notions approximate FH-MFG and Stat-MFG.

Lemma A.3. Let 𝜉 ∈ 𝑆𝐺 (𝜎 2 ). Then
E [|𝜉 − E [𝜉] |] ≤

Definition A.5 (𝛿-FH-MFG-NE). Let (S, A, 𝐻, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝜇0 ) be a FHMFG. Then, a 𝛿-FH-MFG Nash equilibrium is defined as:

A policy-population pair (𝜇𝛿∗ , 𝜋𝛿∗ ) ∈ Δ S × Π is called a 𝛿-Stat-MFG

Establishing lower bounds for the mean-field approximation
of the 𝑁 -player game will be more challenging as it will require
different tools. To establish lower bounds, we will need to use the
following anti-concentration result for the binomial distribution.
Lemma A.4 (Anti-concentration for binomial). Let 𝑁 ∈ N>0
and 𝑋 ∼ Binom(𝑁 , 𝑝) beh drawn from
a binomial distribution for
√ i
some 𝑝 ∈ [1/2, 1]. Then, P 𝑋 ≥ 𝑁2 + 2𝑁

Proof. For 𝑘 0 := 𝑁2 + 2𝑁 , we will lower bound 𝑘=𝑘

when 𝑁 is large enough. If 𝑘 0 < ⌈𝑁 𝑝⌉, then the probability in the statement above is bounded below trivially by 1/2 since
⌊𝑁 𝑝⌋ lower bounds the median of the binomial [18]. Otherwise, if
𝑘 0 ≥ ⌈𝑁 𝑝⌉, then the function 𝑝 → 𝑝 𝑘 (1 − 𝑝) 𝑁 −𝑘 is increasing in
𝑝 in the interval [0, 𝑝]. As 1/2 ∈h [0, 𝑝],√ it is then sufficient
to assume
√ i

𝑝 = 1/2, and to upper bound P 𝑁2 − 2𝑁 < 𝑋 < 𝑁2 + 2𝑁 by 9/10 as

the binomial probability mass is symmetric around 𝑁2 when 𝑝 = 1/2.

A.2

Upper Bound for FH-MFG: Extended Proof
of Theorem 3.2

Throughout this section we work with fixed 𝑃 ∈ P𝐾𝜇 and 𝑅 ∈ R𝐿𝜇 .
For any X valued random variable 𝑥 denote L (𝑥)(·) ∈ Δ X as the
distribution of 𝑥. We start by introducing some notation.
For given 𝑅 and 𝑃 define the following constants:
𝐿𝑠 := sup 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) − 𝑅(𝑠 ′, 𝑎, 𝜇) ,
𝑠,𝑠 ′ ,𝑎,𝜇

𝐿𝑎 := sup 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) − 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎 ′, 𝜇) ,
𝑠,𝑎,𝑎 ′ ,𝜇

𝐾𝑠 := sup

𝑃 (·|𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) − 𝑃 (·|𝑠 ′, 𝑎, 𝜇) ,

𝑠,𝑠 ′ ,𝑎,𝜇

𝐾𝑎 := sup

𝑃 (·|𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) − 𝑃 (·|𝑠, 𝑎 ′, 𝜇) .

𝑠,𝑎,𝑎 ′ ,𝜇

𝑅 and 𝑃 are bounded due to Definition 2.1, thus all constants
𝐾𝑎 , 𝐾𝑠 , 𝐿𝑎 , 𝐿𝑠 are finite and well-defined, and it always holds that
𝐾𝑠 , 𝐾𝑎 ≤ 2 and 𝐿𝑠 , 𝐿𝑎 ≤ 1. With the above definition of constants,
the more general Lipschitz condition holds: ∀ 𝑠, 𝑠 ′ ∈ S, 𝑎, 𝑎 ′ ∈ A,

𝐻 −1 = Λ𝐻 (𝜇 , 𝜋 ). Then for all ℎ ∈

𝜇ℎ − 𝜇ℎ𝜋 ∥ 1 for any given policy 𝜋 .
• Step 2. Bounding difference of 𝑁 agent value function

𝐻 .
𝐽𝑃,𝑅
and the infinite player value function 𝑉𝑃,𝑅
• Step 3. Bounding the exploitability of an agent when each
of 𝑁 agents are playing the FH-MFG-NE policy.
Step 1: Empirical distribution bound. Due to its relevance
for a general connection between the FH-MFG and the 𝑁 -player
game, we state this result in the form of an explicit bound.
Lemma A.7. Suppose for the 𝑁 -FH-MFG (𝑁 , S, A, 𝑁 , 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝛾), agents
𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑁 follow policies 𝜋 𝑖 = {𝜋ℎ𝑖 }ℎ . Let 𝜋 = {𝜋 ℎ }ℎ ∈ Π𝐻

since each b
𝜇ℎ+1 (𝑠) is an average of independent subgaussian random variables given Fℎ . Specifically, each indicator is bounded
1 {𝑠𝑖 =𝑠 } ∈ [0, 1] a.s. and therefore is sub-Gaussian with 1 {𝑠𝑖 =𝑠 } ∈
ℎ+1
ℎ+1
𝑆𝐺 (1/4). Thus we get b
𝜇ℎ+1 (𝑠) ∈ 𝑆𝐺 (1/(4𝑁 )) and apply bound on
expected value discussed in Appendix A.1.

Defining the FH-MFG. We take a particular FH-MFG with 6
states, 2 actions. Define the state-actions sets:
S = {𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right, 𝑠 LA, 𝑠 LB, 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB },

A = {𝑎 A, 𝑎 B }.

Intuitively, the “main” states of the game are 𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right and the 4
states 𝑠 LA, 𝑠 LB, 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB are dummy states that keep track of which
actions were taken by which percentage of players used to introduce
a dependency of the rewards on the distribution of agents over
actions as well as states. Define the initial probabilities 𝜇 0 by:
𝝁 0 (𝑠 Left ) = 𝝁 0 (𝑠 Right ) = 1/2,
𝝁 0 (𝑠 LA ) = 𝝁 0 (𝑠 RA ) = 𝝁 0 (𝑠 RA ) = 𝝁 0 (𝑠 RB ) = 0.

Finally, let 𝛼, 𝛽 > 0 such that 𝛼 + 𝛽 < 1 (to be also defined later).
The reward functions are defined for all 𝜇 ∈ Δ S as follows:
𝑅(𝑠 Left, 𝑎 A, 𝜇) =𝑅(𝑠 Left, 𝑎 B, 𝜇) = 0,
𝑅(𝑠 Right, 𝑎 A, 𝜇) =𝑅(𝑠 Right, 𝑎 B, 𝜇) = 0,

Note that only at odd steps do the agents get a reward, and at
this step, it does not matter which action the agent plays, only the
state among {𝑠 LA, 𝑠 LA, 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB } and the population distribution.
The parameters 𝜖, 𝛼, 𝛽 of the above FH-MFG are “free” parameters
to be specified later.
A minor remark. The arguments of g above will be with probability one in the set Δ2 at odd-numbered time steps, but to formally
satisfy the Lipschitz condition 𝑅 ∈ R 2 one can for instance replace g 𝜇 (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 RB ), 𝜇 (𝑠 LA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 LB ) with g 𝜇 (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 RB ) +
𝜇 (𝑠 Left ), 𝜇 (𝑠 LA )+𝜇 (𝑠 LB )+𝜇 (𝑠 Right ) in the definitions, which will not
impact the analysis since at odd timesteps 𝜇 (𝑠 Right ) = 𝜇 (𝑠 Left ) = 0
for both the FH-MFG and 𝑁 -FH-SAG.
Note that with these definitions, 𝑃 ∈ P1/2𝜖 , 𝑅 ∈ R 2 since only
∀ 𝑠, 𝑠 ′ ∈ S, 𝑎, 𝑎 ′ ∈ A, 𝜇, 𝜇 ′ ∈ Δ S , we have by the definitions:
1
∥𝑃 (·|𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇) − 𝑃 (·|𝑠 ′, 𝑎 ′, 𝜇 ′ )∥ 1 ≤ 2𝑑 (𝑠, 𝑠 ′ ) + 2𝑑 (𝑎, 𝑎 ′ ) + ∥𝜇 − 𝜇 ′ ∥ 1,

When at the states 𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right , the transition probabilities are defined for all 𝜇 ∈ Δ S by:
𝑃 (𝑠 LA |𝑠 Left, 𝑎 A, 𝜇) = 1,

𝑃 (𝑠 LB |𝑠 Left, 𝑎 B, 𝜇) = 1,

𝑃 (𝑠 RA |𝑠 Right, 𝑎 A, 𝜇) = 1,

𝑃 (𝑠 RB |𝑠 Right, 𝑎 B, 𝜇) = 1.

(9)
for any 𝛼, 𝛽 > 0 with 𝛼 + 𝛽 < 1 and 𝛼 < 41 , using the Lipschitz
conditions in (6), (7).
Step 1: Solution of the FH-MFG. Next, we solve the infinite

That is, the agent transitions to one of {𝑠 LA, 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB, 𝑠 LB } to remember its last action and left-right state. When at states {𝑠 LA, 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB, 𝑠 LB },
the transition probabilities are:

It is easy to verify in this case that, if 𝝁 ∗ := {𝜇ℎ∗ }ℎ is induced by 𝜋 ∗ :
𝜇ℎ∗ (𝑠 LA ) = 𝜇ℎ∗ (𝑠 LB ) = 𝜇ℎ∗ (𝑠 RA ) = 𝜇ℎ∗ (𝑠 RB ) = 1/4, if ℎ odd,

𝜇ℎ∗ (𝑠 Left ) = 𝜇ℎ∗ (𝑠 Right ) = 1/2, if ℎ even.
, ∀𝜇, 𝑎.

The other non-defined transition probabilities are of course 0.

In this case, the induced rewards in odd steps are state-independent
(it is the same for all states 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB, 𝑠 LA, 𝑠 LB ), therefore the policy
𝜋 ∗ is the optimal best response to the population and a FH-MFG.
In fact, 𝜋 ∗ is unique up to modifications in zero-probability sets
(e.g., modifying 𝜋ℎ∗ (𝑠 Left ) for odd ℎ, for which P[𝑠ℎ = 𝑠 Left ] = 0). To

see this, for any policy 𝜋 ∈ Π𝐻 , it holds that

Otherwise, if 𝜔𝜖 (𝑝) ∈ (0, 1),

𝜇ℎ𝜋 (𝑠 Left ) = 𝜇ℎ𝜋 (𝑠 Right ) = 1/2, if ℎ even,
𝜋
𝜇ℎ (𝑠 LA ) + 𝜇ℎ𝜋 (𝑠 LB ) = 𝜇ℎ𝜋 (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇ℎ𝜋 (𝑠 RB ) = 1/2, if ℎ odd,
as the action of the agent does not affect transition probabilities
between 𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right in even rounds. Moreover, as odd stages, the action rewards terms only depend on the state apart from the positive
additional term 𝛽1, so the only optimal action will be 𝑎 B . Finally,
for 𝛼 > 0, the actions 𝑎 A, 𝑎 B must be played with equal probability
as otherwise the term 𝛼h(𝜇 (𝑠 RA ), 𝜇 (𝑠 RB )) will lead to the action
with lower probability assigned by being optimal.
Step 2: Population divergence in 𝑁 -FH-MFG. We will analyze the empirical population distribution deviation from 𝝁 ∗ , namely,
we will lower bound E[∥𝜇ℎ∗ − b
𝜇ℎ ∥ 1 ]. The results in this step will be
1
valid for any policy profile (𝜋 , . . . , 𝜋 𝑁 ) ∈ Π: we emphasize that at
even ℎ, b
𝜇ℎ is independent of agent policies in the 𝑁 player game.
In this step, we also fix 1/2𝜀 = 8.
We will analyze b
𝜇ℎ at all even steps ℎ = 2𝑚 where 𝑚 ∈ N ≥0 .
Define the sequence of random variables for all 𝑚 ∈ N ≥0 as 𝑋𝑚 :=

𝜇 2𝑚 (𝑠 Left ). Define G := { 𝑁𝑘 : 𝑘 = 0, . . . , 𝑁 }. Note that for all even
ℎ = 2𝑚, it holds almost surely that b

𝜇ℎ (𝑠 Right ) ∈ G. By the

which completes the first statement of the theorem (as 5𝐻 /2 =

Step 3: Hitting time for G∗ . We will show that the empirical
distribution of agent states almost always concentrates on one of
𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right during the even rounds in the 𝑁 -player game, and bound
the expected waiting time for this to happen. The distributions of
agents over states 𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right in the even rounds are policy independent (they are not affected by which actions are played): hence
the results from Step 2 still hold for the population distribution and
the expected time computed in this step will be valid for any policy.
For simplicity, we define the FH-MFG for the non-terminating
infinite horizon chain, and we will compute value functions up to
horizon 𝐻 . Define the (random) hitting time 𝜏 as follows:

the last line following since 𝑇−1 > 𝑇0 by definition. Solving the two

Step 4: Ergodic optimal response to 𝑁 -players. Next, we
𝐻 −1 ∈ Π𝐻 that is ergodically optimal
formulate a policy 𝜋 br = {𝜋ℎbr }ℎ=0
for the 𝑁 -player game and can exploit a population that deploys
the unique FH-MFG-NE. For all ℎ, the optimal policy will be defined
by:

𝜏 := inf {𝑚 ≥ 0 : b
𝜇 2𝑚 (𝑠 Left ) ∈ G∗ } = inf {𝑚 ≥ 0 : 𝑋𝑚 ∈ G∗ }.
Note that for any 𝑝 ∈ G, it holds that P[𝑋𝑚+1 ∈ G∗ |𝑋𝑚 = 𝑝] =
b
𝜇 2𝑚 (𝑠 Left ) 𝑁 + b
𝜇 2𝑚 (𝑠 Right ) 𝑁 = 𝑝 𝑁 + (1 − 𝑝) 𝑁 ≥ 2 −𝑁 . Therefore

𝑚−1
for all 𝑚 it holds that P[b
𝜇 2𝑚 ∉ G∗ ] ≤ 1 − 2 −𝑁
. By the BorelCantelli lemma, we can conclude that 𝜏 < ∞ almost surely, and in
particular 𝑇𝜏 := E[𝜏 |𝑋 0 = 𝑥] < ∞ for any 𝑥 ∈ G.
Next, we compute the expected value 𝑇𝜏 . Define the following
two quantities:
𝑇−1 := sup {E[𝜏 |𝑋 0 = 𝑥]}
𝑥 ∈ G−1

𝑇0 := sup {E[𝜏 |𝑋 0 = 𝑥]}.

Intuitively, 𝜋ℎbr becomes optimal once all the agents are concentrated in the same states during the even rounds, which happens
very quickly as shown in Step 3. Assume that agents 𝑖 = 2, . . . 𝑁 deploy the unique FH-MFG-NE 𝜋 𝑖 = 𝜋 ∗ , and for agent 𝑖 = 1, 𝜋 1 = 𝜋 br .
We decompose the three components of the rewards for the first
agent, as defined in the construction of the MFG (Step 1):

Step 5: Bounding exploitability. Finally, we will upper bound
also the expected reward of the FH-MFG-NE policy 𝜋 ∗ and hence
lower bound the exploitability. Our conclusion will be that 𝜋 ∗ suffers from a non-vanishing exploitability for large 𝐻 , as 𝜋 br becomes
the best response policy after 𝐻 ≳ log 𝑁 . In this step, we assume the
probability space induced by all 𝑁 agents following FH-MFG-NE

Upper Bound for Stat-MFG: Extended Proof
of Theorem 3.5

Let 𝜇 ∗, 𝜋 ∗ be a 𝛿-Stat-MFG-NE. As before, the proof will proceed in
three steps:
• Step 1. Bounding the expected deviation of the empirical
population distribution from the mean-field distribution
E [∥b
𝜇ℎ − 𝜇 ∗ ∥ 1 ] for any given policy 𝜋 .
• Step 2. Bounding difference of 𝑁 agent value function
𝛾,𝑁 ,(𝑖 )
𝛾
𝐽𝑃,𝑅
and the infinite player value function 𝑉𝑃,𝑅 in the
stationary mean-field game setting.
• Step 3. Bounding the exploitability of an agent when each
of 𝑁 agents are playing the Stat-MFG-NE policy.
Step 1: Empirical distribution bound. We first analyze the
deviation of the empirical population distribution b
𝜇𝑡 over time from
the stable distribution 𝜇 ∗ . For this, we state the following lemma
and prove it using techniques similar to Corollary D.4 of [36].
Lemma A.11. Assume that the conditions of Theorem 3.5 hold,
and that (𝜇 ∗, 𝜋 ∗ ) ∈ Δ S is a Stat-MFG-NE. Furthermore, assume
𝑁 in the 𝑁 -Stat-MFG, define
that the 𝑁 agents follow policies {𝜋 𝑖 }𝑖=1

Lower Bound for Stat-MFG: Extended Proof
of Theorem 3.6

Similar to the finite horizon case, we define constructively the
counter-example: the idea and the nature of the counter-example
remain the same. However, minor details of the construction are
modified, as it will not hold immediately that all agents are on states
{𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right } on even times 𝑡, and that the Stat-MFG-NE is unique
as before.
Defining the Stat-MFG. We use the same definitions for S, A, g, h, 𝜔𝜖
as in the FH-MFG case. Define the convenience functions 𝑄 𝐿 , 𝑄 𝑅
as
𝜇 (𝑠 LA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 LB )
,
𝑄 𝐿 (𝜇) :=
max{𝜇 (𝑠 LA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 LB ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 RB ), 4/9}
𝜇 (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 RB )
𝑄 𝑅 (𝜇) :=
.
max{𝜇 (𝑠 LA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 LB ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 RB ), 4/9}
We define the transition probabilities:

simple computation shows that 𝑅 ∈ R 3 . In this proof, unlike the
𝑁 -FH-SAG case, 𝛼 will be chosen as a function of 𝑁 , namely 𝛼 =
O (𝑒 −𝑁 ).
Step 1: Solution of the Stat-MFG. We solve the infinite agent
game: let 𝜇 ∗, 𝜋 ∗ be an Stat-MFG-NE. By simple computation, one
can see that for any stationary distribution 𝜇 ∗ of the game, probability must be distributed equally between groups of states {𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right }

and {𝑠 LA, 𝑠 LB, 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB }, that is,
𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Left ) + 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Right ) = 1/2,

∗

𝜇 (𝑠 LA ) + 𝜇 (𝑠 LB ) + 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 RB ) = 1/2.
It holds by the stationarity equation Γ𝑃 (𝜇 ∗, 𝜋 ∗ ) = 𝜋 ∗ that
𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Left ) =𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 LA ) + 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 LB ),
𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Right ) =𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 RA ) + 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 RB ),

As before, using the Markov property, Hoeffding, and the fact that
|𝜔𝜖 (𝑥) − 1/2 | ≥ 1/2𝜖 |𝑥 − 1/2 | we obtain ∀𝑘 ∈ 0, . . . , 𝐾 − 1, ∀𝑚 that

Step 3. Exploitability lower bound. As in the case of FH-MFG,
the ergodic optimal policy is given by

𝑠∈S

=𝑃 (𝑠 Right |𝑠 LA, 𝑎 A, 𝜇 ∗ ),
as 𝑃 (𝑠 Right |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ∗ ) = 𝑃 (𝑠 Right |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ∗ ) and similarly 𝑃 (𝑠 Left |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ∗ ) =
𝑃 (𝑠 Left |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜇 ∗ ) for any 𝑠 ∈ {𝑠 LA, 𝑠 LB, 𝑠 RA, 𝑠 RB }, 𝑎 ∈ A. If 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Left ) >

1/4, then by definition 𝑃 (𝑠
Left |𝑠 LA , 𝑎 A , 𝜇 ) < /4, and similarly if
𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Left ) < 1/4, then by definition 𝑃 (𝑠 Left |𝑠 LA, 𝑎 A, 𝜇 ∗ ) > 1/4. So it
must be the case that 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Left ) = 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 Right ) = 1/4. Then the unique
Stat-MFG-NE must be



𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 RA ) = 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 LA ) = 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 RB ) = 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 LB ) = 1/8,

as otherwise the action arg min𝑎∈ A 𝜋 ∗ (𝑎|𝑠 Right ) will be a better
response in state 𝑠 Right and the action arg min𝑎∈ A 𝜋 ∗ (𝑎|𝑠 Left ) will
be optimal in state 𝑠 Right .
Step 2: Expected population deviation in 𝑁 -Stat-SAG. We fix
1/2𝜀 = 3, define the random variable 𝑁 := 𝑁 (b
𝜇0 (𝑠 Right ) + b
𝜇 0 (𝑠 Left )).
We will analyze the population under the event 𝑁 := {| 𝑁 /𝑁 − 1/2 | ≤

inequality. Under the event 𝐸, it holds that b

𝜇𝑡 (𝑠 LA ) > 4/9 almost surely at all 𝑡.
Fix 𝑁 0 ∈ N>0 such that | 𝑁0/𝑁 − 1/2 | ≤ 1/18, in this step we will
condition on 𝐸 0 := {𝑁 := 𝑁 0 }. Once again define the random
process 𝑋𝑚 for 𝑚 ∈ N ≥0 such that

with the modification at odd 𝑚 necessary because of the difference

case. It still holds that 𝑋𝑚 is Markovian, and given 𝑋𝑚 we have
𝑁 0𝑋𝑚+1 ∼ Binom(𝑁 0, 𝜔𝜖 (𝑋𝑚 )). As before, 𝑋𝑚 is independent from
the policies of agents. √

from states {𝑠 Left, 𝑠 Right }, the analysis will be similar under event

B.1 Fundamentals of PPAD

2𝛼
1 −𝛾

We define a search problem S on alphabet Σ as a relation from
a set IS ⊂ Σ∗ to Σ∗ such that for all 𝑥 ∈ IS , the image of 𝑥 under
𝑘
𝑘
S satisfies S𝑥 ⊂ Σ |𝑥 | for some 𝑘 ∈ N>0 , and given 𝑦 ∈ Σ |𝑥 | m
whether 𝑦 ∈ S𝑥 is decidable in polynomial time.
Intuitively speaking, PPAD is the complexity class of search problems that can be shown to always have a solution using a “parity
argument” on a directed graph. The simplest complete example (the
example that defines the problem class) of PPAD problems is the
computational problem End-of-The-Line. The problem, formally
defined below, can be summarized as such: given a directed graph
where each node has in-degree and out-degree at most one and
given a node that is a source in this graph (i.e., no incoming edge
but one outgoing edge), find another node that is a sink or a source.
Such a node can be always shown to exist using a simple parity
argument.
Definition B.1 (End-of-The-Line [7]). The computational problem End-of-The-Line is defined as follows: given two binary
circuits 𝑆, 𝑃 each with 𝑛 input bits and 𝑛 output bits such that
𝑃 (0𝑛 ) = 0𝑛 ≠ 𝑆 (𝑠 𝑛 ), find an input 𝑥 ∈ {0, 1}𝑛 such that 𝑃 (𝑆 (𝑥)) ≠
𝑥 or 𝑆 (𝑃 (𝑥)) ≠ 𝑥 ≠ 0𝑛 .
The obvious solution to the above is to follow the graph node by
node using the given circuits until we reach a sink: however, this
can take exponential time as the graph size can be exponential in
the bit descriptions of the circuits. It is believed that End-of-TheLine is difficult [11], that there is no efficient way to use the bit
descriptions of the circuits 𝑆, 𝑃 to find another node with degree 1.

Proof of Intractability of Stat-MFG

We reduce any 𝜀-GCircuit problem to the problem 𝜀-StatDist for
some simple transition function 𝑃 ∈ P Sim .
Let (V, G) be a generalized circuit to be reduced to a stable
distribution computation problem. Let 𝑉 = |V | ≥ 1. We will define
a game that has at most 𝑉 +1 states and |A| = 1 actions, that is, agent
policy will not have significance, and it will suffice to determine
simple transition probabilities 𝑃 (𝑠 ′ |𝑠, 𝜇) for all 𝑠, 𝑠 ′ ∈ S, 𝜇 ∈ Δ S .
The proposed system will have a base state 𝑠 base ∈ S and 1
additional state 𝑠 𝑣 associated with the gate whose output is 𝑣 ∈ V.

Our construction will be sparse: only transition probabilities in
between states associated with a gate and 𝑠 base will take positive

Given an (approximately) stable distribution 𝜇 ∗ of 𝑃, for each
vertex 𝑣 we will read the satisfying assignment for the 𝜀-GCircuit
problem by the value 𝑢 1 (𝜃 −1 𝜇 ∗ (𝑠 𝑣 )). For each possible gate, we
define the following gadgets.

Weighted addition gadget. Next, we implement the addition gadget 𝐺 ×,+ (𝛼, 𝛽 |𝑣 1, 𝑣 2 |𝑣) for 𝛼, 𝛽 ∈ [−1, 1]. In this case, we also add
one state 𝑠 𝑣 to the game, and define the transition probabilities:
𝑃 (𝑠 base |𝑠 𝑣 , 𝜇) = 1,
𝑃 (𝑠 𝑣 |𝑠 𝑣 , 𝜇) = 0,
𝑢 (𝛼𝑢𝜃 (𝜇 (𝑣 1 )) + 𝛽𝑢𝜃 (𝜇 (𝑣 2 )))

Brittle comparison gadget. For the comparison gate 𝐺 < (|𝑣 1, 𝑣 1 |𝑣),
we also add one state 𝑠 𝑣 to the game. Define the function 𝑝𝛿 :

for any 𝛿 > 0. In particular, if 𝑥 ≥ 𝑦 + 𝛿, then 𝑝𝛿 (𝑥, 𝑦) = 1, and if
𝑥 ≤ 𝑦 − 𝛿, then 𝑝𝛿 (𝑥, 𝑦) = 0. We define the probability transitions
to and from 𝑠 𝑣 as
𝜃𝑝 8𝜀 (𝜃 −1𝑢𝜃 (𝜇 (𝑠 1 )), 𝜃 −1𝑢𝜃 (𝜇 (𝑠 2 )))

max{𝐵, 𝜇 (𝑠 base )}
𝑃 (𝑠 𝑣 |𝑠 𝑣 , 𝜇) = 0,

𝑃 (𝑠 𝑣 |𝑠 base, 𝜇) =

𝑃 (𝑠 base |𝑠 𝑣 , 𝜇) = 1.
Finally, after all 𝑠 𝑣 have been added, we complete the definition
of 𝑃 by setting
∑︁
𝑃 (𝑠 base |𝑠 base, 𝜇) = 1 −
𝑃 (𝑠 ′ |𝑠 base, 𝜇).
𝑠′ ∈ S

We first verify that the above assignment is a valid transition
probability matrix for any 𝜇 ∈ Δ S . It is clear from definitions that
for any 𝜇, 𝑠 ≠ 𝑠 base , 𝑃 (·|𝑠, 𝜇) is a valid probability distribution as
long as 8𝜀 < 1. Moreover, for any 𝑠 ≠ 𝑠 base , it holds that 0 ≤

Error propagation. We finally analyze the error propagation of

so 𝑃 (·|𝑠 base, 𝜇) is a valid probability transition matrix. Finally, the

𝑃 (𝑠 𝑣,base |𝑠, 𝑎) = 0, ∀𝑣 ∈ V, 𝑠 ∈ S, 𝑎 ∈ A,
and an 𝜀 satisfying assignment 𝑝 : V → [0, 1] will be read by

Simple
specify population-dependent rewards 𝑅 ∈ R
, since 𝑅 will not
depend on the particular action but only the state and population

the case that
𝑅(𝑠 𝑣,base, 𝜇) = 0, ∀𝑣 ∈ V, 𝜇 ∈ Δ S .
We assign 𝑅(𝑠 𝑣,1, 𝜇) = 𝑅(𝑠 𝑣,0, 𝜇) = 0, ∀𝜇 for any vertex 𝑣 of the

Hence, in the above, we reduced the 8𝜀-GCircuit problem to
the 𝜀-StatDist problem, completing the proof that 𝜀-StatDist
is PPAD-hard. The fact that 𝜀-StatDist is in PPAD on the other
hand easily follows from the fact that 𝜀-StatDist is the fixed point
problem for the (simple) operator Γ𝑃 , reducing it to the End-ofthe-Line problem by a standard construction [7].

Proof of Intractability of FH-MFG

As in the previous section, we reduce any 𝜀-GCircuit problem
(G, V) to the problem (𝜀 2, 2)-FH-Nash for some simple reward
𝑅 ∈ R Sim . Once again let 𝑉 = |V |.
Associated with each 𝑣 ∈ V we define 𝑠 𝑣,1, 𝑠 𝑣,0, 𝑠 𝑣,base ∈ S. The

(
𝜋0br (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base ) =

0, otherwise

𝜋 0br (𝑎 0 |𝑠 𝑣,base ) = 1 − 𝜋 0br (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base ),
𝜋 1br (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base ) = 1,
𝜋 1br (𝑎 0 |𝑠 𝑣,base ) = 0.

as the summands are all positive. We prove that all gate conditions
are satisfied case by base. Without loss of generality, we assume
𝜀 < 1 below.

we have

The above implies 𝜋0∗ (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base ) ≥ 1 − 𝜀 if 𝜁 = 1, and if 𝜁 = 0, it
implies 𝜋0∗ (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base ) ≤ 𝜀.
Case 2. For any 𝑣 ∈ V such that 𝐺 ×,+ (𝛼, 𝛽 |𝑣 1, 𝑣 2 |𝑣) ∈ G, denoting in short
□ := 𝑢 1 (𝛼𝑉 𝜇1∗ (𝑠 𝑣1 ,1 ) + 𝛽𝑉 𝜇1∗ (𝑠 𝑣2 ,1 ))
= 𝑢 1 (𝛼𝜋0∗ (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣1 ,1 ) + 𝛽𝜋 0∗ (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣2 ,1 )),

△ := 𝑉 𝜇1∗ (𝑠 𝑣2 ,1 ) − 𝑉 𝜇1∗ (𝑠 𝑣1 ,1 ) = 𝜋 0∗ (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣2 ,1 ) − 𝜋 0∗ (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣1 ,1 )
𝑝 1 := 𝜋0∗ (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base )
𝑝 0 := 𝜋0∗ (𝑎 0 |𝑠 𝑣,base )
we have the inequality:
𝑢 1 (|△|) − 𝑝 1𝑢 1 (△) − 𝑝 0𝑢 1 (−△) ≤ 𝜀 2
𝑢 1 (|△|) − 𝑝 1𝑢 1 (△) − (1 − 𝑝 1 )𝑢 1 (−△) ≤ 𝜀 2 .
First assume △ ≥ 𝜀, then
𝑢 1 (△)(1 − 𝑝 1 ) ≤ 𝜀 2 =⇒ 1 − 𝜀 ≤ 𝑝 1,
and conversely if △ ≤ −𝜀,
𝑢 1 (−△)𝑝 1 ≤ 𝜀 2 =⇒ 𝑝 1 ≤ 𝜀,
concluding that the comparison gate conditions are 𝜀 satisfied for
the assignment 𝑣 → 𝜋0br (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base ).
The three cases above conclude that 𝑣 → 𝜋0br (𝑎 1 |𝑠 𝑣,base ) is an 𝜀satisfying assignment for the generalized circuit (V, G), concluding
the proof that (𝜀 0, 2)-FH-Nash is PPAD-hard for some 𝜀 0 > 0. The
fact that (𝜀 0, 2)-FH-Nash is in PPAD follows from the fact that the
NE is a fixed point of a simple map on space Π2 , see for instance
[15].

Proof of Intractability of 2-FH-Linear

Our reduction will be similar to the previous section, however,
instead of reducing a 𝜀-GCircuit to an MFG, we will reduce a 2
player general sum normal form game, 2-Nash, to a finite horizon
mean field game with linear rewards with horizon 𝐻 = 2 (2-FHLinear). Let 𝜀 > 0, 𝐾1, 𝐾2 ∈ N>0, 𝐴, 𝐵 ∈ R𝐾1 ,𝐾2 be given for a
2-Nash problem. We assume without loss of generality that 𝐾1 > 1,
as otherwise, the solution of 2-Nash is trivial.
This time, we define finite horizon game with 𝐾1 + 𝐾2 + 2 states,
1 , 𝑠 2 , 𝑠 1 , . . . , 𝑠 1 , 𝑠 2 , . . . , 𝑠 2 }. Without loss of

by A = [𝐾2 ] = {1, . . . , 𝐾2 }. The initial state distribution will be

We analyze two different cases, accounting for a possible imbalance
between the strategy spaces of the two players, [𝐾1 ] and [𝐾2 ].

Hence, the resulting equations (14), (15) imply that in this case the

we can discard this possibility.
