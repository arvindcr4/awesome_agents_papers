**ARXIV_ID:** 2410.14383v3 [cs.RO]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that leverages language-based inter-robot negotiation to improve the efficiency of training. The approach, called MARLIN, uses large language models to negotiate and debate plans for completing tasks, which are then used to guide the MARL policy. The method dynamically switches between using reinforcement learning and language model-based action negotiation throughout training.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces a novel approach to MARL that leverages language-based inter-robot negotiation
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of MARLIN in simulations and physical robot experiments
* Shows that MARLIN can reach peak performance in fewer training episodes than traditional MARL approaches
* Highlights the potential of large language models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MARL training
* Provides a framework for integrating language-based negotiation into MARL systems
