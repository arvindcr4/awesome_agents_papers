Abstract. This paper presents ongoing research focused on improving the utility of data protected by Global Differential Privacy(DP) in the scenario of summary statistics. Our approach is based on predictions on how an analyst will
use statistics released under DP protection, so that a developer can optimise
data utility on further usage of the data in the privacy budget allocation. This
novel approach can potentially improve the utility of data without compromising
privacy constraints. We also propose a metric that can be used by the developer
to optimise the budget allocation process.

1. Introduction
Differential Privacy (DP) [Dwork and Roth 2014] is a new and powerful approach to implement privacy in datasets. It has been used, for example, in government systems 1 , and
important companies such as Microsoft 2 and Google 3 . However, its application may be
difficult, as it frequently requires a tailored solution for a problem, and decreases the data
utility due to the anonymization process. Thus, the data utility is a constant problem for
DP, being a current research topic the development of approaches that increase data utility
after the anonymization process while the desired privacy is preserved.
Our ongoing research proposes a novel approach to improve data utility in DP.
We exploit predictions on how the data will be used in the further by the Analyst. These
predictions are defined by the developer, the entity that will build the DP solution. The
developer is prone to error, missing its predictions can nullify any benefit or even deteriorate the data utility. However, when correctly predicted our approach permits that
during the budget allocation process of DP, several queries are privileged. These queries
are more influential in how the data will be further used, yielding better utility. Currently,
there is no direct way to find the best budget allocation for our approach. In this paper,
we propose a metric that the developer can use to help to find better budget allocations by
comparing different allocations. However, it is currently a manual process. Our further
research includes developing techniques to find such budget allocations automatically.

Using strategies based on budget allocation to improve utility is not new. There
are several approaches for allocation based on the algorithm that will use the data
[Fang et al. 2019] [Fan and Xu 2019] [Hou et al. 2019]. Other approaches not based
on the algorithm that will use the data also exist, such as in the work of Luo et al.
[Luo et al. 2021] inspired on the allocation of resources. However, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no other approach that manipulates the budget allocation based on
predictions on further use of the data in summary statistics.

2. Problem Statement
The developer is an entity that can release several summary statistics to the public using
DP. In such situation, there will be a privacy parameter budget ϵ that is defined externally
must be respected by the developer. This budget needs to be divided among all the
statistics that will be made available. This budget allocation between different statistics
is a pivotal part of our work, and it can be done in different ways [Yan et al. 2020].
By the Sequential Composition property sharing the privacy budget keeps the
same privacy guarantee [Dwork and Roth 2014]. To release the data, the developer can
build a DP scenario to help in providing the best possible quality of data to the Analyst.
The Analyst in an entity that intends to consume the data already available to the public.
It will use these statistics in equations to generate new insights about the data. The distinction between Statistics, a result from a query in the database with the DP noise added,
and the Equations that use multiple statistics from a DP solution to create new insights
into the data is important. A third entity is the Curator that works as intended in DP, as
an intermediary that will add noise to queries before making them available to the analyst.
Here we will treat it as an non-interactive fashion DP solution, as the queries are already
defined and are released as statistics to the Analyst.

Figure 1. Scenario

Figure 1 summarises our scenario. The developer will build the DP scenario. For
this, it will project which equations the analyst will create when the DP scenario is built

(i). The Developer then creates a budget allocation for all statistics that will benefit these
equations by generating the less noise possible. This is a pivotal aspect of our work.
We will develop this notion in further works, but since each statistic carry its
own noise, the interaction between them caused by mathematical operations in equations
change the total size of the noise. Depending on the budget allocation this total noise will
have a different size. The developer wants to minimize it, which can be done by choosing
the optimal budget allocation. In the next section, we present a metric to compare budget
allocations that can be used by the developer to compare budget allocations in order to
find the optimal solution that minimizes the noise.
Having the optimal budget allocation, it can create the DP scenario (ii). after
this, the solution works as normal DP solution (iii) (iv) (v). The Analyst will receive the
statistics that the curator did as queries to the database with the added noise. Which the
analyst will use in equations. This approach can potentially increase the utility of data
without compromising privacy. However, it is highly dependent on the developer’s ability
to predict the equations that the analyst will use. It improves the utility of the data by
prioritizing the predicted equations at the cost of the utility of non-predicted equations.
It is also reliant on budget allocation, which is the parameter that the developer can finetune. In the next section, we propose a metric that allows comparing different budget
allocations in order to optimize the selection.

3. A Metric to support the process of budget allocation
In this section we propose a metric that can be used to compare different distributions
of the privacy budget ϵ. Initially, an array (1) with a total of nsta statistics that will be
released by the developer ranging from sta1 to stansta is defined.
Sta = [sta1 , sta2 , ..., stansta ]

(1)

A second array (2) Sen stores the sensitivity from sen1 to sennsta . Each statistic
in array Sen has an equivalent member in array Sta at the same position in the equivalent
array. For example, the sensitivity for element stai is seni .
Sen = [sen1 , sen2 , ..., sennsta ]

(2)

A third array that we will be used is the budget allocation array (3) Bud with
nsta elements. This array represents the privacy budget distribution, for each element in
the original array Sta there is an element in Bud in the same position. This represents
the privacy budget allocated for that specific statistic. For example, the privacy budget
allocated for element stai is budi .
Bud = [bud1 , bud2 , ..., budnsta ]

(3)

There are two limitations (4) (5) to the values in this array. The sum of all the
elements in Bud must be equal to the privacy budget ϵ.

nsta
X

Bud[i] = ϵ

(4)

i=1

Also, all the elements in the array need to have a value greater than 0.
∀i(Bud[i] > 0)

(5)

To help organize our data for use in further functions we will consolidate all these
three arrays (Sta, Sen and Bud) in one array of tuples (6) T up. Each tuple will aggregate
the statistic, sensitivity, and budget t = (sta, sen, bud). We will also define a function (7)
os that retrieves the value sta from a tuple.

T up = [(sta1 , sen1 , bud1 ), (sta2 , sen2 , bud2 ), ..., (stansta , sennsta , budnsta )]

(6)

os((sta, sen, bud)) = sta

(7)

In the previous section, we described what are Equations. We will now define
them as a mathematical function eq(T up) ⇒ R. An equation uses multiple specific
statistics to calculate its output value. The equation eq will receive all tuples with their
statistics from array T up, although it will use just a few specific ones.
Equations are defined by the developer on a case-by-case base. Thus, it is impossible to define the operation beyond the function signature. However, we will show two
examples of equations using lambda function. In our example scenario we have an array
T up = [t1, t2, t3, t4]. The developer will define two operations: The first one (8) eq1 will
receive the statistic value from t2, and t3 to sum up their values. In the second one (9)
eq2, the value of t1, t2 will be added, and then divided by t4.
eq1(T up) = ((λx y.os(x) + os(y))T up[2])T up[3]

eq2(T up) = (((λx y z.

os(x) + os(y)
)T up[1])T up[2])T up[3]
os(z)

(8)

(9)

Finally, there will exist a fourth array (10) Eqs, that will hold tuples with two
values te = (eq, sen). The first value is the function of an equation, defined by the
developer. The second one is the sensitivity of that operation if it was a statistic directly
retrieved from the database instead of an equation composed of multiple statistics. Further
expanding, eq1 previously described, is the sum of the statistics from T up[2], and T up[3].
However, it is possible to get the result of this equation by directly querying the database,
which would be the same as retrieve a new statistic. This alternative way of retrieving the
value of eq1 would have a sensitivity, the value of sen is the sensitivity if instead of using
eq we would query the database for a new statistic with the same result as eq. For each

equation defined by the developer an tuple in Eqs will be created. The size of this array
depends of how many equations will be defined by the developer, we define th size as neq
Eqs = [te1 , te2 , ...teneq ]

(10)

To quantify the utility of a single statistic we will create a function us(t) that
receive a single tuple from T up. We will not give details about what means utility and
how to measure in this work. It will be approached in further work, we make a briefly
comment in Section 4. The important consideration for this work is that it will output a
positive real number representing the loss of utility, a higher number means less utility.
Similar to us, we will create another function to quantify the utility of an equation. This function ue(te) receives a tuple from Eqs. It outputs a positive real number
representing the loss of utility, a higher number means less utility.
Finally, our metric (11) will receive as input the array T up, and Eqs. The output
is a score that represents the utility for a budget allocation Bud, lower means a better
utility. The metric function is defined as follows.

M etric(T up, Eqs) =

nsta
X
i=1

us(T up[i]) +

neq
X

ue(Eqs[i])

(11)

i=1

Array Sta, and Eqs are based on the information that will be disclosed and equations that the developer predicts the analyst will use. This implies that it will not change
after being defined. Although, array Bud represents a single instance of all possible divisions of the privacy budget ϵ to the statistics. The objective of the developer is to find the
combination of Bud that yields the lowest metric value. Which means the highest utility.
One final consideration is why the sensitivity is included in all tuples. The sensitivity can be used to relativize the values of function us, and ue. A counting query
in the database would create a statistic with a sensitivity of one, which would result in
a small noise in absolute values when used in a mechanism in DP. While other queries
would create a statistic with higher values for sensitivity that could result in bigger noise
in absolute values. Both statistics are of equal importance, but the higher noise in absolute
value would create a higher return in the function us. We plan to use the sensitivity in us
and ue to balance all statistics and equations giving them equal importance. This will be
developed in further works with the definition of us, and ue.

4. Conclusion and Further Work
In our work, we presented a novel approach to improve the utility of DP scenarios by
predicting equations that the analyst will do with the released statistics and benefit them
in the budget allocation. To support the approach we presented a new metric system under
development that can be used to measure the utility of a specific budget allocation. The
approach is designed to be used with summary statistics.
The potential improvement in utility comes from the budget allocation. Certain allocations increase or decrease the amount of noise that a predicted equation will generate.
Using the metric a developer can try to find the allocation that benefits the most taking

into consideration all predicted equations. Since it works just on the budget allocation it
does not affect the solution privacy.
As a future work, we are evaluating our proposed approach both by theoretical
analysis and experimental evaluation. Perhaps the most important is a way of measuring
the utility, this measurement would be used in functions us, and uo to output utility in
a quantitative way. Initially, we are planning to use the amount of expected noise added
to a statistic and equation through the DP mechanism as a way to measure utility. The
purpose of this measurement could also benefit from a study to evaluate the impact of
different budget allocations in simple equations using basic operations, such as sum, multiply, and division, using the proposed measurement. This could be useful to evaluate the
measurement and show how different allocations can impact the utility.
The metric now can be used to compare two different budget allocations. An
avenue for research is to allow the developer to directly find the optimal budget allocation.
Two methods can be explored for this: the first one is using a numerical approach such as
gradient descent. The second one is an analytical approach such as a closed mathematical
formula. However, further research is needed to evaluate if this approach is feasible.
