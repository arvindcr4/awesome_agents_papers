Abstract Snippet:
Autonomous Option Invention for Continual Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Planning Rashmeet Kaur Nayyar and Siddharth Srivastava  arXiv:2412.16395v1 [cs.AI] 20 Dec 2024  Autonomous Agents and Intelligent Robots Lab, School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA {rmnayyar, siddharths}@asu.edu  Abstract Abstraction is key to scaling up reinforcement learning (RL). However, autonomously learning abstract state and action representations to enable transfer and generalization remains a challenging open problem. This paper presents a novel approach ...
