**TITLE:** Safety-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Control via Risk-Sensitive Action-Value Iteration and Quantile Regression

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 05_safe_constrained_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a risk-sensitive quantile-based action-value iteration algorithm that balances safety and performance by augmenting the quantile loss with a risk term encoding safety constraints. The algorithm uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate the cost distribution and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* A risk-sensitive quantile-based action-value iteration algorithm that balances safety and performance
* Use of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate the cost distribution
* Use of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure
* Theoretical guarantees for the contraction and finite-time convergence of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator
* Experimental evaluation of the algorithm in a reach-avoid navigation task, showing improved safety and performance compared to risk-neutral baselines.
