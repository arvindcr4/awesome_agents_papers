Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "arXiv:1707.06347v2 [cs.LG] 28 Aug 2017  Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms John Schulman, Filip Wolski, Prafulla Dhariwal, Alec Radford, Oleg Klimov OpenAI {joschu, filip, prafulla, alec, oleg}@openai.com Abstract We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a “surrogate” objective function using stochastic gradient ascent."
- "Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
