Abstract Snippet:
Zero-Sum Positional Differential Games as a Framework for Robust Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Learning Approach  Anton Plaksin 1 Vitaly Kalev 2  arXiv:2405.02044v1 [cs.LG] 3 May 2024  Abstract  (see also Robust Adversarial RL (Pinto et al., 2017)), in which such uncertainty or disturbances are interpreted as actions of a second adversarial agent, and thus the problem is reduced to seeking the agents’ policies robust to any opponent’s actions.  Robust Reinforcement Learning (RRL) is a promising Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm aimed at training robust to uncertainty or disturbances models...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "This paper is the first to propose considering the RRL problems within the positional differential game theory, which helps us to ob"

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 03_multi_agent_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as multi-agent, marl, cooperative, matching the research direction's core themes.
