Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Advantage Actor-Critic with Reasoner: Explaining the Agent’s Behavior from an Exploratory Perspective Muzhe Guo1 , Feixu Yu2 , Tian Lan2 , Fang Jin1 1  arXiv:2309.04707v1 [cs.AI] 9 Sep 2023  2  Department of Statistics, George Washington University, United States Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, United States {muzheguo, fxyu, tlan, fangjin}@gwu.edu  Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for solving complex decision-making problems, but its lack of transparency and interpretability has been a major challenge in domains where decisions have significant real-world consequences."
- "In this paper, we propose a novel Advantage ActorCritic with Reasoner (A2CR), which can be easily applied to Actor-Critic-based RL models and make them interpretable."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
