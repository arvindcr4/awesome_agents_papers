**TITLE:** Towards Efficient Online Exploration for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a new exploration scheme for online Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) that targets uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. The algorithm uses a dynamic calibration policy that evolves with the iterations, guiding exploration away from uninformative comparisons.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper identifies a conceptual drawback in existing optimism-based exploration strategies for RLHF and proves lower bounds to show that they can lead to inefficient exploration.
* The proposed algorithm establishes regret bounds of order T (β+1)/(β+2), which scales polynomially in all model parameters.
* The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the algorithm under a multi-armed bandit setup of RLHF.
* The algorithm is shown to be robust and efficient in scenarios with small β, where the reference policy is poorly aligned with human preference.
