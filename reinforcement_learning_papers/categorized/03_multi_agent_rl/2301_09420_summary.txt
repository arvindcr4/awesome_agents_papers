**TITLE**: On Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients and their Explainability for SMARTS Environment
**ARXIV_ID**: 2301.09420v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper explores two approaches to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the SMARTS environment: Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (MADDPG). The authors implement and compare the performance of these algorithms on four evaluation metrics: completion, time, humanness, and rules. They also discuss the explainability of the better-performing algorithm, MADDPG, and its potential applications in autonomous driving.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* Implementation of MAPPO and MADDPG for MARL in the SMARTS environment
* Comparison of the performance of MAPPO and MADDPG on four evaluation metrics
* Discussion of the explainability of MADDPG and its potential applications in autonomous driving
* Identification of potential areas for improvement in the performance of MADDPG
* Proposal of future work, including the integration of computer vision algorithms and evolutionary computing techniques to improve the performance of MADDPG.
