ABSTRACT
Analysing learning behaviour in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environments is challenging, in particular with respect to individual decision-making. Practitioners frequently tend
to study or compare MARL algorithms from a qualitative perspective largely due to the inherent stochasticity in practical algorithms
arising from random dithering exploration strategies, environment
transition noise, and stochastic gradient updates to name a few.
Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects,
but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends,
might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as
coupled stochastic dynamical systems, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from
dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity
of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions
for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict
safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to
rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their
inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of
multi-agent learning processes.

INTRODUCTION

Reinforcement learning (RL) in multi-agent settings routinely exhibits abrupt performance shifts, oscillations, and inconsistent game
equilibria during training [23, 39]. RL practitioners observe these
phenomena across a sweep of training runs even with the same
modelling architectures and hyperparameters, making stability at
training time and asymptotic performance both difficult to reason
about and costly to validate empirically [27]. Unstable training can
lead to brittle policies that fail under small perturbations in initialisation or environment [1, 27]. In safety-critical applications such
as autonomous driving, performance oscillations or catastrophic
divergence pose unacceptable risks [2, 22]. Assessing a learning

system’s stability and sensitivity to parameter changes provides
crucial insight into its robustness, generalisation capacity, and longterm adaptability in dynamic environments. In fact, non-linear and
chaotic dynamics can lead to oscillatory and inconsistent behaviour
that may appear as random [50]. Positively, there is typically some
structure in the phase space of the dynamical system that explains
the seemingly purely stochastic behaviour [49].
There is a long tradition of framing learning as a dynamical
system: cognitive science and neuroscience have advocated dynamical systems views of agents and environments [19]; evolutionary
game theory models population adaptation via dynamical systems
analysis [38]; and several RL algorithms can be proved to converge
by viewing updates as a dynamical system. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems can be studied through a dynamical
systems perspective. For example, Cross Learning [14] is closely related to replicator dynamics [11]. Q-learning has also been shown
to behave like best-response dynamics, which often align with
replicator dynamics [55]. However, these studies either (i) focus
on population level and deterministic dynamics (e.g., replicator or
mean-field limits), or (ii) treat environment as a dynamical system
while representing the learning rule only implicitly.
In this paper, for the first time, we present the study of individual decision-making in MARL systems using tools from dynamical
systems theory from an individual perspective. In order to do so,
we view the environment and agent learning updates as coupled
dynamical systems [7]. This agent-centric perspective closely reflects the true agent–environment interactions, whereas modelling
only a population-level strategy tends to average out many of these
interactions and couplings, eliminating the stochastic behaviour
inherent in practical MARL implementations. Adding more agents
to the system can be interpreted as introducing additional coupled
dynamical systems, resulting in increasingly complex non-linear
dynamics. In contrast to previous work, we therefore adopt an individual agent-centric parameter-space viewpoint that models the
learning updates themselves as a discrete-time dynamical system,
then study the stability and sensitivity of the coupled learner(s)
and environment system. This approach allows us to leverage the
mature toolbox of dynamical systems theory, including mathematical methods for analysing stationary (or invariant) distributions
[18, 48], limit cycles, quasi-cycles, random and strange attractors,
and Lyapunov stability [36] in non-linear, stochastic, coupled systems. In the paper, we will provide a pragmatic description of the

application of these tools in the context of MARL1 with a focus on
the analysis of the emergent dynamics of the interacting agents.
Using this dynamical-systems perspective, we demonstrate that
many seemingly unstable or stochastic learning trajectories in
MARL can be explained by low-dimensional dynamical structures
emerging from the coupling between agents and their environments. We show that empirical stability and sensitivity metrics
derived from dynamical systems theory correspond closely to observed training behaviour across a variety of MARL settings. This
connection enables a practical diagnostic framework: one can identify when a learning process transitions from stable to unstable
regimes, assess robustness to perturbations, and potentially guide
the tuning of hyperparameters to maintain desirable dynamical
properties.
Concretely, the contributions of this paper can be summarised
as follows:
• We formalise MARL updates as coupled discrete-time dynamical systems in parameter space, both in the deterministic and
stochastic settings as a basis for understanding individual
decision making in MARL.
• We introduce a practical methodology for analysing the stability of MARL systems coupled by applying established tools
from dynamical systems theory, including the computation
of invariant distributions, Lyapunov exponents, recurrence
plots, and fractal dimensions, enabling a comprehensive characterisation of the system’s dynamical regimes, transitions,
and resilience properties.
• We utilise these analytical methods in a suite of stateless
and state-based MARL games with tabular and deep MARL
methods, highlighting the applicability and generality of
these methods. We adjust hyperparameters of agents to understand the sensitivity of the underlying dynamical systems
to these changes.
• Finally, we discuss potential applications of this toolbox,
particularly its use in analysing stability and sensitivity for
algorithm design.

BACKGROUND

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated remarkable successes across a wide range of domains, including competitive multiplayer games [9, 56], cooperative and competitive social dilemmas [3, 4, 15, 33], fluid flow and control problems [40, 51],
and even environmental policy derivation [43, 44, 60]. Despite these
successes, MARL remains substantially more challenging to train
and analyse than its single-agent counterpart. Non-stationarity
induced by multiple agents learning concurrently often produces
oscillatory behaviours or brittle dependence on hyperparameters
leading to instability or non-convergence, which complicate reproducibility and theoretical understanding [10]. Unlike single-agent
RL, where convergence to optimal policies can often be guaranteed
under certain assumptions [57], MARL algorithms frequently fail
to converge or converge only under restrictive assumptions such as
of a zero-sum game [32] or in the mean field limit [58]. As a result,
a general theoretical understanding of MARL convergence remains

to the existing excellent resources in the areas, e.g., [50].

elusive, motivating ongoing efforts to reconcile empirical analysis
with theoretical insights.
Evolutionary Game Theory & Replicator Dynamics. Game
Theory has been extensively used to understand MARL equilibria
and convergence [59], providing static views of the system but
struggles with the non-stationarity in multi-agent learning. Evolutionary Game Theory, a branch of Game Theory, has emerged
as a more suitable alternative as it models adaption through selection and mutation over time. Labelled as Replicator Dynamics
[30, 38], the agent-centric system is reformulated as a population
level dynamical system that denotes the evolving population share
of agent strategies over time. Evolutionary game theory introduces
evolutionary stable strategies that are an asymptotically stable fixed
point of the replicator dynamical system. MARL updates and replicator dynamics are strongly linked as the population share of each
strategy can be related to the probability of taking a certain action,
as if viewing through the lens of a single agent [10]. For example,
Cross learning [14] admits a formal correspondence to replicator
dynamics in normal-form games, converging to the replicator dynamics in the continuous time limit [11]. Subsequent work extended
these links to more complex scenarios, including stochastic and
sequential games [21, 28, 29]. However, there is a disconnect between replicator dynamics theory and practical implementations of
MARL. Firstly, an infinite population or mean-field approximation
is assumed, abstracting away from the local, trajectory-dependent
updates of individual agents. Secondly, algorithm specific details
such as exploration, non-myopic updates, bootstrapping, and function approximation that are inherent sources of stochasticity aren’t
modelled by replicator dynamic. Consequently, replicator dynamics
can provide powerful qualitative and geometric insights for MARL
(e.g., why rock-paper-scissors leads to cycling), but fails to capture
finite-agent effects, stochastic learning, and other complexities of
modern MARL algorithms.
Other Deterministic Methods. Alternatively, Barfuss et al. [6]
look at deriving the deterministic limit of three common RL algorithms - Q-learning, SARSA, and actor critic learning. By separating
the adaption timescale (learning) from the interaction timescale
(game dynamics) they map stochastic update rules found in traditional RL algorithms (e.g., 𝜖-greedy exploration) to continuous
deterministic flows [6]. Thus enabling them to leverage deterministic dynamical systems theory to understand the attractors of the
systems. However, adjusting algorithms so that they act in deterministic ways reduces much of their performance as well as the
ability to scale to larger state spaces with function approximation.
What is gained in theoretical predictive performance comes at the
cost of scalable implementations.
Chaos in MARL. One of the major difficulties in MARL is the
prevalence of chaotic dynamics, which makes proving convergence
particularly challenging. For example, Sato et al. [47] demonstrate
how replicator dynamics can generate complex orbits as well as
chaotic attractors and Galla et al. [20] and Sanders et al. [46] show
that two player and many player games respectively can exhibit
fixed points, limit cycles, or chaotic behaviour dependent on algorithm parameter choices. These findings raise the fundamental
question of whether fixed points are consistently attainable in such
systems at all, or whether approximations and assumptions used to
enforce convergence inadvertently strip away the very dynamics

that could be essential for capturing the richness of agent interactions. In this sense, the “chaos” observed in MARL is not merely
a technical obstacle, but a core characteristic of the domain that
complicates both theory and practice.

OUR APPROACH AT A GLANCE

In this work we focus on understanding individual decision-making
of MARL agents, an agent-centric rather than population level viewpoint. Our perspective is therefore complementary to population
based approaches: rather than modelling population averages, we
directly analyse the learning dynamics of individual agents.

3.1

Definitions and the Concept

Dynamical Systems. A dynamical system is a mathematical framework for describing the evolution of a system over time, formally
consisting of a state space 𝑋 together with an evolution rule 𝜙𝑡 that
describes how the state changes. The state space is typically in R𝑛
or a manifold, and the evolution rule can be either continuous or
discrete in time as well as either deterministic or stochastic. Continuous time deterministic dynamics are expressed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE):
𝑥¤ = 𝑓 (𝑥 (𝑡)),

𝑥 (0) = 𝑥 0,

(1)

where 𝑓 : 𝑋 → R𝑛 is a vector field (or flow field), and the solution
is the flow 𝜙𝑡 (𝑥 0 ) that represents a trajectory of the system starting
from the initial state. Discrete time deterministic dynamics are
described by an iterated map:
𝑥𝑡 +1 = 𝐹 (𝑥𝑡 ),

𝑥 0 ∈ 𝑋,

(2)

where 𝐹 : 𝑋 → 𝑋 is a transformation and the system evolves by
iteration of 𝐹 .
One can visualise the state space (aka phase space) as a landscape
of possible states that the dynamical system evolves through. Trajectories (realisations) of the system emit structure in the phase space,
known as a phase plot/portrait, that illustrate the behaviour of the
system. Attractors are locations in phase space the system evolves
towards regardless of initial conditions, indicating asymptotic behaviour. There are three main types of attractors: fixed points point locations in which the system converges as the vector field
vanishes or 𝐹 (𝑥 ∗ ) = 𝑥 ∗ , limit cycles - attractors the system periodically loops or orbits around, strange attractor - bounded region of
phase space where the system exhibits irregular behaviour leading
to a fractal structure.
Coupled dynamical systems exhibit the same structure, but are
comprised of multiple dynamical systems that have cross or coupling terms within 𝑓 or 𝐹 , such as the canonical bidirectionally
coupled Logistic Map [52]:
𝑥𝑡 +1 = 𝑥𝑡 (𝑟 𝑥 − 𝑟 𝑥 𝑥𝑡 − 𝛽𝑥 𝑦 𝑦𝑡 )
𝑦𝑡 +1 = 𝑦𝑡 (𝑟 𝑦 − 𝑟 𝑦 𝑦𝑡 − 𝛽 𝑦𝑥 𝑥𝑡 ),

(3)

where 𝑟 𝑥 , 𝑟 𝑦 , 𝛽𝑥 𝑦 , 𝛽 𝑦𝑥 are parameters that adjust the chaotic behaviour and coupling strength.
Markov Decision Process/Markov Game. RL utilises the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) framework, defined by the tuple ⟨S, A, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝛾⟩.
Where S is the set of states, A the set of actions, 𝑃 (𝑠 ′ | 𝑠, 𝑎) the
transition probability of moving to state 𝑠 ′ after taking action 𝑎 in
state 𝑠, 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎) the reward function, and 𝛾 ∈ [0, 1) a discount factor.

At each timestep 𝑡, the agent observes 𝑠𝑡 ∈ S, chooses 𝑎𝑡 ∈ A,
receives reward 𝑟𝑡 = 𝑅(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ), and transitions to 𝑠𝑡 +1 ∼ 𝑃 (· | 𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ).
To generalise MDPs for multiple agents, the framework becomes a
stochastic game or Markov Game (MG), a multi-agent MDP with
𝑁 , 𝑃, {𝑅𝑖 } 𝑁 , 𝛾) . Where
𝑁 agents defined by the tuple S, {A𝑖 }𝑖=1
𝑖=1
𝑖
S is the shared state space, A is the action space of agent 𝑖,
𝑃 (𝑠 ′ | 𝑠, 𝑎 1, . . . , 𝑎 𝑁 ) is the transition probability dependent on the
joint action a = (𝑎 1, . . . , 𝑎 𝑁 ), and 𝑅𝑖 (𝑠, a) is the reward function
for agent 𝑖. Unlike the single-agent case, where the environment is
stationary under a fixed policy, multi-agent systems are inherently
non-stationary since the dynamics depend on the evolving policies
of all agents.
Single-Agent RL as a Dynamical System. Consider a discretetime dynamical system for a singular agent. We assume for now
that everything is deterministic and highlight later the sources of
potential stochasticity.
𝑠𝑡 +1 = 𝑓 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ),

(4)

where 𝑎𝑡 is the agent action, 𝑠𝑡 is the state at time step 𝑡, and 𝑓 (·, ·)
is our transition function that is deterministic at time 𝑡. This defines
the environmental dynamical system where agent actions have an
effect on the transition dynamics. Similarly to Beer [7] we model a
coupled dynamical system of the learning RL based agent and the
environmental dynamical system:
𝜃ℎ+1 = 𝑔(𝜃ℎ , sℎ , aℎ ),

(5)

where ℎ is a learning update step, which relates to a certain number of time steps 𝑡. 𝜽ℎ (a scalar or vector) is the state of the agent
at update ℎ, perhaps the model parameters or similar, and an update depends on the trajectory of states and actions gained in that
update window. Actions are generated from a policy 𝜋 using the
environment state 𝑠𝑡 and the agent state 𝜃ℎ : 𝑎𝑡 = 𝜋 (𝑥𝑡 ; 𝜃ℎ ) We want
to understand the stability of the function 𝑔, which can be done by
analysing what kind of attractor it settles upon. This definition represents the simplest form, but it can be extended to incorporate
practical implementations such as replay buffers, target networks,
or off-policy learning, where the samples used in the updates may
originate from different behavioural policies.
MARL as a Dynamical System. For clarity in this section we
assume just two agents in this system but the definition can be
expanded to general agents. Upon introducing multiple agents our
discretised transition dynamics become:
𝑠𝑡 +1 = 𝑓 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡1, 𝑎𝑡2 ),

(6)

where the superscript identifies the agent. This creates a coupled
dynamical system between the updates of the individual agents’
dynamical systems as the trajectories are dependent on the updates
of other agents, defined as:
1
𝜃ℎ+1
= 𝑔1 (𝜃ℎ1 , sℎ , aℎ1 )
2
𝜃ℎ+1
= 𝑔2 (𝜃ℎ2 , sℎ , aℎ2 ),

(7)

where an agent updates its internal representation given a set of
historical states and its own actions. Different MARL algorithms
change 𝑔𝑖 (e.g., independent learners or opponent modelling), altering the coupling strength/structure. Additional variables can be
added creating further coupling, such as opponent actions or other
feature representations used for agent updates. In the following, we

• Sensitivity analysis: Once the phase-space structure can be
analysed, we can assess how parameter changes affect stability, providing insight into the system’s sensitivity.
• Control: By quantifying stability and sensitivity in the coupled MARL dynamical system, we can inform strategies for
improved control.

focus on the simplest case where an agent makes decisions about
the system only from global state information and its own action,
defined in agent parameter space:

2
𝜃ℎ+1
= 𝑔2 𝜃ℎ2 , 𝑓 𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋𝜃 1 (𝑠𝑡 ), 𝜋𝜃 2 (𝑠𝑡 ) , 𝜋𝜃 2 (𝑠𝑡 ) .

(8)

Our goal is to measure and compare stability and sensitivity of 𝑔
across MARL algorithms, games, and hyperparameters, beyond
only fixed-point existence.
The Impacts of Stochasticity. Equation 8 presents the simplest
coupled dynamical system for a fully deterministic setting. In practical settings, multiple sources of stochasticity arise within the
system, stemming from environmental transitions, exploratory
mechanisms such as random dithering, sampling from policy distributions, and stochastic gradient updates. Traditionally, these
stochastic elements have been approximated deterministically to
enable analytical tractability. In contrast, we explicitly model these
sources of randomness to more faithfully capture the behaviour of
MARL agents as a coupled stochastic dynamical system:


𝜃ℎ+1
= 𝑔1 𝜃ℎ1 , 𝑓 𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋𝜃 1 (𝑠𝑡 ) + 𝜉𝑡 , 𝜋𝜃 2 (𝑠𝑡 ) + 𝜉𝑡 + 𝜂𝑡 , 𝜋𝜃 1 (𝑠𝑡 ) + 𝜉𝑡 + 𝜁ℎ

(9)
where 𝜉𝑡 represents stochasticity in exploration strategies or policy
sampling, 𝜂𝑡 the environment transition noise, and 𝜁ℎ the stochastic
gradient updates. Below, we present a version that subsumes all
sources of stochasticity into a single term:


1
𝜃ℎ+1
= 𝑔1 𝜃ℎ1 , 𝑓 𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋𝜃 1 (𝑠𝑡 ), 𝜋𝜃 2 (𝑠𝑡 ) , 𝜋𝜃 1 (𝑠𝑡 ) + 𝜈ℎ


2
𝜃ℎ+1
= 𝑔2 𝜃ℎ2 , 𝑓 𝑠𝑡 , 𝜋𝜃 1 (𝑠𝑡 ), 𝜋𝜃 2 (𝑠𝑡 ) , 𝜋𝜃 2 (𝑠𝑡 ) + 𝜈ℎ ,
(10)
where 𝜈ℎ is the combined stochastic effect term.
Comparison to Replicator Dynamics. For clarity, we distinguish
our agent-centric perspective from the population-level replicator
dynamics. The latter can be formulated as a continuous-time dynamical system defined by:
𝑢¤𝑖 = 𝑢𝑖 [𝑤𝑖 (u) − 𝑤¯ (u)] ,

(11)

where u = (𝑢 1, 𝑢 2, ..., 𝑢𝑛 ) represents the population state vector
representing the percentage of the population belong to each of
the 𝑛 strategies, 𝑤𝑖 (·) is the fitness function of a specific strategy,
and 𝑤¯ (·) is the average fitness of the total population. As the 𝑤¯ (·)
term is an expectation over the whole population, this averages out
many of the stochastic effects.

3.2

Dimensions of our Analysis

Equation 10 provides a general definition of a coupled dynamical
system for two agents, which during learning generates a resultant
phase portrait in (𝜃 1, 𝜃 2 ) for any combination of environment and
MARL agents. Leveraging stochastic dynamical systems theory,
we can diagnose and quantify the behaviour of the underlying
system dynamics. Below are three primary avenues opened by this
framework, which we explore in more detail in subsequent sections:
• Stability analysis: Understanding the asymptotic performance
of a MARL system allows us to rigorously validate the resulting game equilibria.

4

EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

To explore the three avenues above we utilise the same environment
and experimental conditions. For the individual components, such
as specific tooling or methods required for each avenue (e.g., dynamical systems theory methods), we introduce them in the relevant
section. We consider four canonical stateless repeated games and
one larger multi-state environment. Prisoner’s Dilemma: A standard social dilemma with a unique Nash equilibrium (defection),
though cooperation can arise under repeated interaction [5, 41].
Matching Pennies: A zero-sum game with a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Stag Hunt: A coordination game with multiple equilibria
(cooperative “stag” or risk-dominant “hare”). Chicken: A cooperative/competitive game where mutual aggression is costly, with two
pure-strategy equilibria (one player swerves while the other does
not) and a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Overcooked: A cooperative
multi-agent environment in which two players must coordinate to
prepare and deliver dishes in a shared kitchen. The environment’s
high-dimensional, partially observable state space make it a challenging test bed for studying learning dynamics [13]. Appendix
A presents the detailed descriptions and configurations of these
environments.
We use two independent learner algorithms that closely align
with replicator dynamics. In tabular Q-learning, each agent learns
its own 𝑄-function independently, typically with 𝜖-greedy exploration. However, in stateless repeated games, deterministic Q-learning
approximates replicator dynamics in the continuous-time, infinitesimal step-size limit if it uses Boltzmann (Softmax) exploration [10].
In policy gradient, using the REINFORCE trick reduces to replicator
dynamics in the mean-field limit, since subtracting the baseline
corresponds to subtracting the average payoff [8]. Further, we look
at Independent Deep Q Networks (IDQN) [53], which, by utilising
neural network function approximation, scales to the larger state
space environments such as Overcooked, but inherently has many
more stochastic elements.

UNDERSTANDING INDIVIDUAL
DECISION-MAKING IN MARL
5.1 Stability Analysis
Overview. Analysing the stability of a MARL system relates to
understanding the asymptotic performance, indicating potential
game equilibria. Traditional game theory and evolutionary game
theory provide static equilibria, a singular fixed point that the
system as a whole tends towards, but which is not always seen
with practical MARL algorithms [30]. When working with environments and agents that are amenable to replicator dynamics, closed
form solutions arise and thus one can plot the gradient vector plot
signalling the flow of the replicator dynamical system. Since our
approach is data-driven, we visualise realisations of the dynamical
system in parameter space, also known as policy traces. Figure

Figure 1: Comparison between replicator dynamics and realisations of Policy Gradient, Tabular Q-learning, and IDQN with
Boltzmann exploration in the four stateless environments. Replicator dynamics are represented by the analytical vector field
as well as a realisation in blue from an arbitrary initial condition. Other algorithms realisations are defined by the legend.
Realisations start from circular points and end at stars.
1 compares the replicator dynamics phase plot and a realisation,
with an agent-centric realisation of Q-learning, Policy Gradient,
and IDQN agents all using Boltzmann exploration so that the parameters relate to action probabilities. In general, the replicator
dynamics flow field is closely followed by the true realisations of
each agent. Both Q-learning and the Policy Gradient approach are
tuned to follow replicator dynamics by using very small learning
rates and Boltzmann exploration to reduce the effect of stochasticity. However, although IDQN also uses Boltzmann exploration,
there is still stochasticity in the function approximation, gradient
updates, and other features such as target networks. The rapidly expanding cycle in Matching Pennies and the move towards defection
in Chicken against the replicator dynamics flow can be attributed
to these additions.
Instead, by focusing on an agent-centric stochastic coupled dynamical system framework, we aim to understand agent behaviour
directly from data. This comes at the cost of precise prediction, but
it avoids the pitfalls of assuming purely deterministic dynamics.
We can analyse the true structure in parameter phase space of arbitrary combinations of environments and algorithms, in a way
that complements the predictive findings from replicator dynamic
analysis where they apply. The challenge is that when stochasticity
is present, fixed points and limit cycles are no longer well-defined in
the strict sense, since process noise perturbs trajectories. Classical
terminology (e.g. fixed points, attractors, stability) can still be used,
but it refers to these noisy counterparts.
Formally, let the update rule for one agent be written as a Markov
process:
𝜃ℎ+1 = 𝑔(𝜃ℎ , 𝑠𝑡 , 𝝅) + 𝜈ℎ .
(12)
We define a stationary distribution 𝜌 𝜃 that satisfies:
𝜃ℎ ∼ 𝜌 𝜃 ⇒ 𝜃ℎ+1 ∼ 𝜌 𝜃 .

(13)

While exact solutions are often intractable, empirical approximations of 𝜌 𝜃 can be obtained by simulating trajectories for long
horizons (or batched across initial conditions), yielding an ergodic
estimate. The shape and properties of 𝜌 𝜃 determine whether the
system admits noisy analogues of fixed points, cycles, or chaotic
attractors. If the distribution focuses on a contained area of the

phase space then we may have a fixed point. Quasi-cycles define
a situation where the underlying deterministic behaviour would
converge to a fixed point or limit cycle but the stochasticity forces
it to enter a limit cycle with noise. These manifest not as a true
closed orbit, but as sustained oscillatory behaviour, leading to a
“smeared” ring in 𝜌 𝜃 . To make this concrete, we introduce several
quantitative and qualitative diagnostics:
• Stationary (invariant) distributions [18, 48]: Probability distribution over 𝜃 . If the Frobenius norm ∥Σ∥ 𝐹 of the covariance
of 𝜌 𝜃 is low it indicates convergence to a fixed point.
• Lyapunov exponents [36]: Lyapunov exponents quantify how
quickly two trajectories diverge or converge, a hallmark
of stability or chaos. For trajectories 𝜃ℎ and 𝜃ℎ′ starting 𝜖
| |𝜃ℎ −𝜃 ′ | |

apart, 𝜆 = limℎ→∞ ℎ1 log | |𝜃 0 −𝜃ℎ′ | | . Negative exponents sug0
gest convergence to a noisy fixed point, near-zero values
indicate cycles or neutral stability, and positive exponents
are evidence of chaos.
• Recurrence plots [16]: Dynamical systems over time can visit
states recurrently, visualising the pattern of these revisits
indicates ordered, periodic, or chaotic behaviour. Defined as a
binary matrix 𝑅𝑖 𝑗 where 𝑅𝑖 𝑗 = 1 if ||𝜃 𝑖 −𝜃 𝑗 || < 𝜖, else 0.
• Fractal dimensions of attractors [54]: Chaotic attractors often have fractal geometry occupying a fractional dimension between integer values. Using states 𝜃 𝑖 , calculating:
Í
𝐶 (𝑟 ) = 𝑁12 𝑖,𝑗 1{||𝜃 𝑖 − 𝜃 𝑗 || < 𝑟 } denotes the probability
two points are within distance 𝑟 . For small 𝑟 , 𝐶 (𝑟 ) ∼ 𝑟 𝐷 2
where 𝐷 2 is the correlation dimension. 𝐷 2 ≈ 0 is a fixed
point, 𝐷 2 ≈ 1 a limit cycle, and 𝐷 2 non-integer > 1 a fractal
attractor (signal of chaos).
Please refer to Appendix B for implementation details of the
above quantities. Figure 2 compares the stationary distribution for
Prisoner’s Dilemma and Matching Pennies, and also between IDQN
agents that use Boltzmann and 𝜖-greedy exploration. The former
relates to replicator dynamics, and as expected the stationary distribution has most mass at the sink points matching the replicator
dynamics vector field in Figure 1. In Prisoner’s Dilemma this looks
like a tightly concentrated stationary distribution in the top right

Figure 3: Recurrence plots from a realisation of training two
IDQN agents in Prisoner’s Dilemma and Matching Pennies.
Figure indicates times when the coupled dynamical system
of all agents visits the same area in phase space at the time
on the 𝑥-axis and 𝑦-axis. Intuitively this means locations are
marked when 𝜃 𝑖 ≈ 𝜃 𝑗 when 𝑖 = 𝑥, 𝑗 = 𝑦. The identity band is
masked out as when 𝑖 = 𝑗 it is always recurrent.

corner, and since we are using Boltzmann exploration this relates
to an interpretable action probability. Some mass in the bottom
left indicates that for some initial conditions convergence does not
match replicator dynamics. In Matching Pennies the distribution
covers the four corners of parameter space since the cycling quickly
diverges, as seen in Figure 1. For IDQN with stochastic 𝜖-greedy
exploration strategy the behaviour is much more varied, parameters are no longer bounded between 0 and 1 and thus cannot be
interpreted as action probabilities. For Prisoner’s Dilemma the stationary distribution has the most mass around the top right and
bottom left vertices, indicating convergence of the parameters to
one of two fixed points, even with the stochasticity causing “trails”.
However, in Matching Pennies we observe an approximate limit
cycle, indicating some quasi-cycle in parameter space.
Further quantitative evidence in Table 1 supports these claims.
In Prisoner’s Dilemma 𝜆max ≈ 0 and a fractal dimension 𝐷 2 ≈ 0

indicate a stable fixed point is reached. Conversely, in Matching
Pennies, values for 𝜆max and 𝐷 2 indicate cyclical behaviour. Figure 3 qualitatively compares the recurrence plots for Prisoner’s
Dilemma and Matching Pennies, the identity band is masked out as
when 𝑖 = 𝑗 it is always recurrent so adds no extra information. In
Prisoner’s Dilemma the most prominent features are the long solid
bands that run parallel to the identity line, these indicate segments
of the system’s trajectory are running parallel to each for a period
of time. This is a strong indicator of determinism and predictability: a deterministic process produces long diagonal lines, whereas
a stochastic process exhibits almost none [37]. The pattern here
suggests the system follows a regular, repeating path through its
state space. If it were strictly periodic, the plot would show evenly
spaced diagonal lines, as seen for Matching Pennies. The arc-like
structures, typically arising from oscillations whose frequency or
amplitude vary over time, indicate quasi-periodicity [17].
So far we have focussed on environments and number of agents
that are amenable to plotting. When working with higher agent
parameter counts or more agents this quickly becomes impossible.
The empirical quantities described do not need visualisation to
be understood, but ideally we would like a visual aid for simpler
intuition and qualifiable results. Higher-dimensional phase spaces
can only be visualised if projected onto a two- or three-dimensional
subspace, which inherently leads to information loss (e.g., using
Principal Component Analysis [31]). However, recurrence plots
yield a two-dimensional representation of a dynamical system [16].

Figure 5 highlights a recurrence plot of Overcooked environment,
indicating determinism and convergence to a fixed point.
To summarise, analysing the MARL system as an agent-centric
coupled dynamical system enables a practitioner to clearly understand the stability and asymptotic performance of an agent’s true
behaviour. Further, our quantitative and qualitative insights are
able to scale to environments and agent numbers that can’t be easily
visualised, opening the door for analysis in any environment. When
working with classical state-based games, the insights from replicator dynamics generally align with our findings, indicating the
usefulness of a paired approach for understanding MARL stability.

5.2

Sensitivity Analysis

So far, we have analysed the phase-space structure of the MARL
dynamical system to understand its stability. This serves as a useful
post-hoc diagnostic tool, helping practitioners assess the asymptotic performance arising from specific combinations of environments and agent types. Given that we can analyse the phase-space
structure, can we also understand how it varies with particular
dynamical system inputs? In particular, we seek to characterise
the topological changes in the phase space induced by varying
hyperparameters or by employing different learning functions 𝑔.

To address this, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by sweeping
over 𝛾, the discounting value in IDQN, as well as 𝜖End . When using 𝜖greedy we instantiate with 𝜖 = 0.9 and exponentially decay during
learning until 𝜖End . For each setting, we simulate ensembles of
trajectories across multiple random seeds, discard burn-in, and
estimate the maximal Lyapunov exponent and fractal dimension 𝐷 2
by aggregating post-burn-in policy traces. Plotting these quantities
as functions of the swept parameter produces Figure 4. It is clear
that increasing 𝛾 reduces cycling in Matching Pennies drastically as
𝛾 → 1. Setting 𝜖End = 0, which removes all exploration stochasticity
at the end of training, results in convergence to a fixed point, as
indicated by 𝜆max, 𝐷 2 → 0. Interestingly, a small increase tends to
produce cyclical behaviour, but increasing further reduces this effect
which may indicate convergence toward a smaller-radius limit cycle
or quasi-cycle compared to the case with 𝜖End ≈ 0.4. Figure 6 further
supports these claims quantitatively: the far left figure shows a clear
limit cycle with determinism, the centre left a quasi-cycle as the
spread of diagonal lines indicates higher stochasticity, the centre
right has hallmarks of the beginnings of chaos, and finally the far
right is almost purely stochastic with very faint structure.
These sensitivity experiments reveal not only the shape of the
MARL phase space, but also why it assumes that shape under different hyperparameter settings. This, in turn, enables us to anticipate how learning stability and long-term behaviour evolve as
hyperparameters (including sources of stochasticity) vary, thereby
providing a principled connection between hyperparameter tuning
and dynamical-systems analysis.

5.3

Control

In the previous sections, through the lens of dynamical systems
theory we have gained quantitative understanding of the phase
space structure and how this changes given differing parameters.
So far, our analysis has treated stability and sensitivity as post-hoc
diagnostics. A natural next step is to close the loop, using these
quantities to control the long-run behaviour of a MARL system. For
instance, how must we adjust the underlying update functions 𝑔 in
order to ensure a tighter stationary distribution that has no limit
or quasi-cycles? In this section we hypothesise about potential
avenues rather than explicit algorithm design. We could define
control objectives like the following: dampen cycling in Matching
Pennies by pushing 𝜆max negative and/or pushing 𝐷 2 to 0.

of 𝛾 = {0.5, 0.99} and 𝜖End = {0.4, 0.0} are presented.
Analytical results on the stability and sensitivity of the system
can be leveraged as pseudo-rewards or related quantities to guide
agent learning. A straightforward approach is a meta-learning setup
in which agent hyperparameters are adapted toward desired stability characteristics driven by dynamical system metrics. This
embodies stability-aware MARL, where dynamical systems diagnostics inform online adaptation. Such control schemes complement
traditional reward-driven learning by ensuring that emergent behaviour operates in regimes that are not only high-reward but also
stable, predictable, and interpretable.

6

IMPLICATIONS

A central motivation for our work is the need to understand MARL
at the level where decisions are actually made: the learning updates of individual agents. Population-based approaches, such as
replicator dynamics, offer elegant closed-form descriptions of adaptation but necessarily smooth out the heterogeneity, stochasticity,
and algorithmic detail that drive practical MARL behaviour. By
adopting an agent-centric dynamical systems perspective, we recover these missing layers of granularity, enabling direct analysis
of the coupled dynamics that govern how agents learn, interact,
and adapt. From an analytical viewpoint, this perspective provides
a principled framework for quantifying stability and sensitivity
in the presence of stochasticity and approximation. Techniques
from dynamical systems theory, including invariant distributions,
Lyapunov exponents, and recurrence analysis, enable us to characterise whether learning updates converge to equilibrium, exhibit
cyclical patterns, or enter chaotic regimes. Stable convergence signifies the emergence of a consistent equilibrium policy or joint
strategy, whereas oscillatory or chaotic regimes expose conditions
under which learning remains non-stationary or unpredictable. By
examining how these regimes change under small perturbations to
parameters or environment dynamics, we obtain a direct measure
of the system’s robustness and sensitivity. Whilst our analysis is
conducted in parameter space, these parameters can be mapped
into the environment or reward phase space, thereby enabling a
practitioner to understand whether parameter convergence corresponds to convergence toward a desirable attractor in reward or
environment space. Crucially, this agent-centric framework scales
naturally to high-dimensional agents with function approximation

and non-trivial environments, where population-level or mean-field
abstractions become intractable. It thus serves as a bridge between
theoretical analysis and empirical practice, providing diagnostic
tools applicable to both tabular and deep MARL systems. In doing
so, it allows practitioners and theorists alike to reason more systematically about when and why multi-agent learning remains stable,
how instabilities emerge, and how algorithmic design choices shape
long-term dynamical behaviour.

7

CONCLUSION

In this work, we have advanced an agent-centric, dynamical-systems
perspective on MARL. By explicitly treating the learning updates
of individual agents as coupled stochastic dynamical systems, we
have moved beyond deterministic, population-level abstractions
in replicator dynamics and related frameworks, advancing toward
an individual-level understanding of decision-making in MARL
systems. This shift has enabled us to capture sources of instability
and stochasticity inherent in practical MARL, such as exploration,
gradient noise, and function approximation. Using tools from modern dynamical systems theory we have demonstrated how long-run
MARL behaviour can be rigorously characterised even in highdimensional environments. Sensitivity analyses further linked these
dynamical signatures to hyperparameters, providing explanations
for abrupt behavioural shifts.
Looking ahead, this work suggests several promising directions,
summarised threefold. Firstly, we have explored a small subset of
methods from dynamical systems theory to analyse stability and
sensitivity; future work could incorporate additional techniques for
a more holistic understanding. Secondly, our approach has been
empirical. Stochastic invariant distribution could be represented
analytically via a Fokker-Planck equation [42], enabling direct calculations of stability and sensitivity, as demonstrated by Leung et al.
[34]. Alternatively, it could be modelled empirically using novel partial differential equation methodologies [35]. Thirdly, some forms
of stochasticity in MARL diminish over learning; for instance, random dithering typically decays exponentially. What implications
might this have for the attractors of such systems? By recognising
learning itself as a coupled dynamical process, we establish a principled foundation for analysing, predicting, and controlling complex
behaviours that emerge in multi-agent systems.

We first consider a set of four stateless matrix games, which serve
as canonical benchmarks for analysing fundamental multi-agent
interaction dynamics. These environments consist of single-step
interactions in which agents select actions simultaneously and receive rewards according to fixed payoff matrices. As there is no
temporal component or state transition, they provide a controlled
setting for examining coordination, competition, and equilibrium
behaviour under simplified yet illustrative conditions. Exact implementations of the four environment’s payoff matrices are in the
tables below.

Stationary Distribution Estimation

The stationary distributions of joint policy trajectories that represent the coupled stochastic dynamical system are estimated empirically from long-run samples of the agents’ learning dynamics.
For each game (e.g., Prisoner’s Dilemma, Matching Pennies), the
coupled learning system is simulated for 𝑛 steps iterations over 𝑛 runs
random seeds. A burn-in phase of 𝑛 burn steps is discarded to eliminate transient behaviour.
Denoting by 𝜽ℎ = (𝜃ℎ1 , 𝜃ℎ2 ) the parameter vector for two agents
at update time ℎ, the stationary samples are obtained as
S=

𝑛Ø

If 𝜃 1, 𝜃 2 are scalars, and there are two agents, then they are combined into a two-dimensional array and used to form a normalised
empirical density 𝑝ˆ (𝜃 1, 𝜃 2 ) visualised as a 2D histogram. If 𝜃 1, 𝜃 2 are
vectors, or there are more than two agents, then dimensions must
be reduced to enable a visualisation. There are many techniques
for doing this each with their pros and cons, and with inherent
information loss. This serves as an approximation of the invariant
measure of the stochastic learning process.

value for paper results we can take any of the following approaches:
total variance (i.e. the Trace), average variance (of the Trace), or
the Frobenius norm [12], amongst many other options. We focus
on the last option, the Frobenius norm ∥Σ∥ 𝐹 computed as:
∥Σ∥ 𝐹 =

This provides a scalar summary of the overall magnitude of
variability and coupling strength among all components. Unlike the
other two options, the Frobenius norm accounts for covariance (or
cross) terms rather than just the diagonal terms with the Trace. This
norm is a compact descriptor of the complexity of the stationary
fluctuations [12].

(Maximum) Lyapunov Exponent Estimation

To quantify local sensitivity to initial conditions, the maximal Lyapunov exponent 𝜆max is estimated using a nearest-neighbour diver𝐻 ∈

, where Θ is the joint dimensionality of agent parameters. For
each point 𝜃 𝑖 , its nearest neighbour 𝜃 𝑗 (𝑖 ) is identified subject to a
Theiler [54] window (i.e. ignoring temporal neighbours within ±𝑤
indices). The Euclidean distance between their forward evolutions
at lag 𝑧 is tracked as:
𝑑𝑖 (𝑧) = ∥𝜃 𝑖+𝑧 − 𝜃 𝑗 (𝑖 )+𝑧 ∥ 2,

and the average logarithmic divergence ⟨log 𝑑 (𝑧)⟩ is fitted linearly
over a time window 𝑧 ∈ [𝑧 min, 𝑧 max ]. The slope of this line provides
an estimate of 𝜆max :

Recurrence and Correlation Plots

Recurrence plots visualise the structure of revisitations in phase
space by thresholding pairwise distances between states:
𝑅𝑖 𝑗 = 1{∥𝜃 𝑖 − 𝜃 𝑗 ∥ 2 ≤ 𝜀}.

(6)

The threshold 𝜀 is chosen such that a desired recurrence rate (e.g.,
8%) is achieved. The resulting binary matrix 𝑅 encodes temporal
proximity patterns; diagonal lines correspond to epochs of predictability, whereas scattered points indicate stochastic or chaotic
transitions. For more details on reading recurrence plots please
refer to the following resources [16, 17, 37].

B.5

Correlation Dimension (Fractal Dimension)

The correlation (fractal) dimension 𝐷 2 is computed using the Grassberger–Procaccia algorithm [25]. For a scalar or low-dimensional
time series 𝜃ℎ , delay embedding with dimension 𝑚 and lag 𝜏 constructs vectors
Θℎ = [𝜃ℎ , 𝜃ℎ+𝜏 , . . . , 𝜃ℎ+(𝑚−1)𝜏 ] ∈ R𝑚 .

(7)

Pairwise distances 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 = ∥Θ𝑖 − Θ 𝑗 ∥ 2 are evaluated, and the correlation sum

𝐶 (𝑟 ) =

∑︁
2
1{𝑑𝑖 𝑗 < 𝑟 }
𝑁 (𝑁 − 1) 𝑖< 𝑗

(8)

is estimated over a logarithmic range of radii 𝑟 , where 𝑁 is the
effective number of reconstructed state vectors available after embedding. In the scaling region where 𝐶 (𝑟 ) ∝ 𝑟 𝐷 2 , a linear regression
of log 𝐶 (𝑟 ) vs. log 𝑟 yields the correlation dimension 𝐷 2 . This measures the fractal geometry of the attractor underlying the agents’
stationary dynamics.

Summary of Computed Metrics

In summary, for each analysed trajectory the following quantities
are reported:
• Stationary distribution 𝑝ˆ (𝜽 ): empirical invariant measure.
• ∥Σ∥ 𝐹 : Frobenius norm of the covariance, capturing overall
variability.
• 𝜆max : largest Lyapunov exponent, measuring chaotic divergence.
• Recurrence plots: graphical tools used to visualize the times
at which a dynamical system returns to states similar to
previous ones, as defined by a chosen error tolerance.
• 𝐷 2 : correlation (fractal) dimension of the reconstructed attractor.
Together, these diagnostics provide a comprehensive characterisation of the dynamical complexity, stationarity, and stability
properties of the interacting reinforcement learning agents.
