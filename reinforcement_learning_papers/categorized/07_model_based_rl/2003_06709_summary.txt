**PAPER:** FACMAC: Factored Multi-Agent Centralised Policy Gradients
**TITLE:** FACMAC: Factored Multi-Agent Centralised Policy Gradients
**ARXIV_ID:** 2003.06709v5
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** FACMAC is a multi-agent reinforcement learning method that uses a centralised but factored critic and a centralised policy gradient estimator to learn decentralised policies. The method is designed for cooperative tasks with discrete and continuous action spaces.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces a new method for multi-agent reinforcement learning that uses a centralised but factored critic and a centralised policy gradient estimator.
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of the method on various tasks, including a novel benchmark suite called Multi-Agent MuJoCo.
* Shows that the method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on several tasks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) benchmark.
* Provides a detailed analysis of the method's performance and its advantages over existing methods.
