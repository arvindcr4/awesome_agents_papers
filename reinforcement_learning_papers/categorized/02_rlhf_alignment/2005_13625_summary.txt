**TITLE:** Revisiting Parameter Sharing in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2005.13625v8
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a method for coping with heterogeneous action and observation spaces in multi-agent environments learned via full parameter sharing. The authors introduce a novel method for modifying the observation spaces to allow for parameter sharing, and prove that this method enables convergence to optimal policies. They also experimentally validate the method and show that it can empirically allow for learning in environments with heterogeneous action, observation, and agents.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Introduced a novel method for modifying the observation spaces to allow for parameter sharing in multi-agent environments.
* Proved that the proposed method enables convergence to optimal policies.
* Experimentally validated the method and showed that it can empirically allow for learning in environments with heterogeneous action, observation, and agents.
* Proposed five simple approaches to agent indication for image-based observations and evaluated their relative success in different environments.
* Showed that the proposed methods can be used together to empirically allow for learning in environments with heterogeneous action, observation, and agents.
