**PAPER:** Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient
**TITLE:** Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient
**ARXIV_ID:** 2311.01953v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a new method called Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient (OptiMAPPO) that applies optimism to multi-agent policy gradient methods to alleviate the relative overgeneralization problem. The method involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, facilitating optimistic updates in policy gradient methods. The authors provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The paper proposes a new method called OptiMAPPO that applies optimism to multi-agent policy gradient methods.
* The method involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, facilitating optimistic updates in policy gradient methods.
* The authors provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point.
* The method is evaluated on a variety of complex benchmarks, including Multi-agent MuJoCo and Overcooked, and shows improved performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
* The paper also compares the proposed method with existing optimistic Q-learning based methods and shows that OptiMAPPO can better employ the advantage of optimism and achieve stronger performance.
