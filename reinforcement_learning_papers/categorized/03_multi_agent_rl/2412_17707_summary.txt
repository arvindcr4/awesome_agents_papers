**TITLE:** SMAC-Hard: Enabling Mixed Opponent Strategy Script and Self-play on SMAC

**ARXIV_ID:** 2412.17707v2 [cs.AI]

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper introduces SMAC-HARD, a novel benchmark designed to enhance the evaluation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms. SMAC-HARD supports customizable opponent strategies, randomization of adversarial policies, and interfaces for MARL self-play, enabling agents to generalize to varying opponent behaviors and improve model stability.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of SMAC-HARD, a new benchmark for MARL algorithms
* Customizable opponent strategies and randomization of adversarial policies
* Interfaces for MARL self-play to improve model stability
* Evaluation of widely used and state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on SMAC-HARD
* Black-box testing framework to evaluate policy coverage and adaptability of MARL algorithms
