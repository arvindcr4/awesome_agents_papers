TITLE: OPTICAL TIME-SERIES PHOTOMETRY OF THE SYMBIOTIC NOVA V1835 AQUILAE
ARXIV_ID: 2209.11251v1
RESEARCH_METHOD: 02_rlhf_alignment (although the paper does not explicitly mention reinforcement learning or alignment, it does discuss the analysis of time-series photometry data, which could be related to reinforcement learning or alignment in a broader sense)

METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The paper presents an analysis of time-series CCD photometry data for the symbiotic nova V1835 Aquilae, using a variety of telescopes and cameras. The data were processed using standard methods, and the resulting light curves were analyzed using the discrete Fourier transform method implemented in VStar. The authors also used the Welch & Stetson method to detect variable stars.

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* The paper presents a detailed analysis of the light curve of V1835 Aquilae, including the detection of a periodicity at 419 ± 10 days, which is interpreted as the system's orbital period.
* The authors also provide photometry, periods, and light curve classifications for 22 variable stars in the field around V1835 Aquilae, including 9 new variable stars.
* The paper discusses the properties of the variable stars, including their periods, amplitudes, and colors, and provides a classification of the stars into different types (e.g., Mira, semi-regular, ellipsoidal).
* The authors also estimate the distance to V1835 Aquilae and provide a discussion of the star's properties, including its reddening, absolute magnitude, and possible mass transfer mechanism.
