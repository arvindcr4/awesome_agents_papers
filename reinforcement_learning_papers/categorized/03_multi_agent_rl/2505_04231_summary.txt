**TITLE**: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Smart Intersections
**ARXIV_ID**: 2505.04231v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a novel roadside unit (RSU)-centric cooperative driving system leveraging global perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The system employs a two-stage hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework, combining offline pre-training using conservative Q-learning (CQL) and behavior cloning (BC) with online fine-tuning using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) and self-attention mechanisms.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* A novel hybrid RL framework combining offline pre-training and online fine-tuning techniques for cooperative driving at unsignalized intersections.
* Development of personalized policy networks tailored to distinct driving roles (e.g., left-turn, straight, right-turn) at intersections.
* Integration of a self-attention mechanism into role-based MARL to enhance policy adaptability to varying vehicle numbers and dynamic interactions.
* Demonstration of the model's generalization capability and rapid adaptability across diverse unsignalized intersection scenarios.
