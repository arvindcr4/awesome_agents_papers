**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper introduces an approach for deep reinforcement learning (RL) that improves upon the efficiency, generalization capacity, and interpretability of conventional approaches through structured perception and relational reasoning. It uses self-attention to iteratively reason about the relations between entities in a scene and to guide a model-free policy.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The authors propose a relational deep reinforcement learning approach that combines relational learning with deep learning.
* They introduce a novel navigation and planning task called Box-World, which requires abstract relational reasoning and planning.
* They achieve state-of-the-art performance on six mini-games in the StarCraft II Learning Environment.
* They demonstrate that their approach allows for better generalization to unseen situations and improved interpretability of the learned representations.
* They provide a detailed analysis of the attention mechanism and its role in relational reasoning.
