**PAPER:** QTRAN++: Improved Value Transformation for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** QTRAN++: Improved Value Transformation for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2006.12010v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** QTRAN++ is an improved version of the QTRAN algorithm for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. It introduces a multi-head mixing network for value transformation, stabilizes the training objective, and removes the strict role separation between the action-value estimators.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* QTRAN++ improves the performance of QTRAN by stabilizing the training objective and introducing a multi-head mixing network for value transformation.
* The algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment.
* QTRAN++ is able to learn effective policies in complex environments with multiple agents and partial observability.
* The algorithm is compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including QMIX, VDN, and QTRAN, and shows improved performance in most scenarios.
