Curiosity-based reward schemes can present powerful exploration mechanisms which facilitate the discovery of solutions for complex, sparse or long-horizon tasks. However, as the agent learns to reach previously
unexplored spaces and the objective adapts to reward new areas, many behaviours emerge only to disappear due to being overwritten by the constantly shifting objective. We argue that merely using curiosity for
fast environment exploration or as a bonus reward for a specific task does not harness the full potential
of this technique and misses useful skills. Instead, we propose to shift the focus towards retaining the
behaviours which emerge during curiosity-based learning. We posit that these self-discovered behaviours
serve as valuable skills in an agent’s repertoire to solve related tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the
continuous shift in behaviour throughout training and the benefits of a simple policy snapshot method to
reuse discovered behaviour for transfer tasks.

1. Introduction
Intrinsic motivation (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2009;
Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2009; Oudeyer et al., 2007;
Schmidhuber, 1991, 2010) can be a powerful concept to endow an agent with an automated mechanism to continuously explore its environment in
the absence of task information. One common
way to implement intrinsic motivation is to train a
predictive model alongside the agent’s policy and
use the model’s prediction error as a reward signal for the agent encouraging the exploration of
previously unfamiliar transitions in the environment - a method also known as curiosity learning (Pathak et al., 2017). Curiosity-esque reward
schemes have been used in different ways to facilitate exploration in sparse tasks (Burda et al.,
2018b; Houthooft et al., 2016) or pre-train policy networks before fine-tuning them on difficult
downstream tasks (Sekar et al., 2020). In environments where the main task objective is highly correlated with thorough exploration, curiosity-based
approaches have also been shown to solve the main
task without any additional reward signal (Burda
et al., 2018a).
However, in environments with multiple possible tasks – e.g. in manipulation scenarios where

objects could be interacted with or re-arranged in
different ways – not only the final behaviour of a
curious exploration run might be of interest, but intermediate behaviours can correlate with solutions
to different tasks. Naturally, the constantly changing curiosity objective leads to the emergence of
diverse behaviours during training – much akin to
the learning process of infants which develop useful skills by playing (Haber et al., 2018). Yet, only
a fraction of this diversity is ultimately retained in
a downstream, task-specific policy – which might
also be biased towards exploration as a side-effect
– or it is even completely overwritten after finetuning. This problem of catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey and Cohen, 1989) is well-known for any
neural network which operates under a shifting
data distribution. However, the intermediate behaviours which emerge and disappear during learning based on curiosity can be of relevance for different tasks of interest. If we were able to extract and
leverage emergent behaviour, we could turn the
process of exploration from a service for task-driven
reinforcement learning into a rich continual learning setup in its own right (Hadsell et al., 2020).
Despite technical challenges, the discovery of
self-induced curricula of skills holds a tantalising
prospect for an agent’s ability to solve broad sets

Figure 1 | Two example timelines depicting the emergence of behaviour while pursuing a curiosity objective on a 9-DoF JACO arm (top) and on a 20-DoF OP3 humanoid robot (bottom). Each timeline represents
the evolution of behaviour from a single random seed on a single simulated actor. At each point in time,
the agent exhibits a single behaviour which slowly evolves over time as the curiosity objective changes.
A detailed description of the emergent behaviour in this experiment is provided in section 4.1 and corresponding quantitative results are shown in figs. 3 and 4. The corresponding videos can be found at: https://

of long-horizon tasks when it is able to draw upon
potentially useful skills. For instance, a robotic
arm which has already discovered how to reach,
grasp and lift objects in its workspace has a much
easier time exploring and learning a policy to stack
objects later on, if it recombined its previously acquired skills. Recent works (Hertweck et al., 2020;
Riedmiller et al., 2018; Wulfmeier et al., 2020b)
have studied the influence of specific tasks across
a spectrum of manual engineering effort like in
the stacking example on the learning success of
complex manipulation policies. A curiosity-based
approach could further reduce the effort of designing a curriculum of tasks and reward functions with
a set of self-discovered skills.
In this paper, we study behaviour which emerges

based on a curiosity objective in two continuous
control settings: manipulation and locomotion. In
contrast to prior work in this domain, we implement curiosity-based exploration in an off-policy
learning setting which improves upon on-policy
implementations in terms of data-efficiency and
presumably increases the diversity of emerging behaviours. Furthermore, we look at the utilisation
of the self-discovered behaviour for learning new
downstream tasks. In particular, we find that even
a naïve baseline which treats snapshots of a curiosity policy as fixed exploration skills in a hierarchical learning setup can perform commensurately
with a hand-designed curriculum learning setup.
Our findings suggest that the identification and
exploitation of self-discovered behaviours can be a
2

fruitful avenue for future work in the learning of
complex robotics tasks.
In summary, we make the following two contributions: First, we introduce SelMo, an off-policy realisation of a self-motivated, curiosity-based method
for exploration which is applied to two robotic manipulation and locomotion domains in simulation.
We show that even in those complex, 3D environments, meaningful and diverse behaviour emerges
solely based on the optimisation of the curiosity
objective. Second, we propose to extend the focus
in the application of curiosity learning towards the
identification and retention of emerging intermediate behaviours and support this conjecture with
a baseline experiment which uses self-discovered
behaviours as auxiliary skills in a hierarchical reinforcement learning setup.

2. Related Work
The utilisation of forward modelling error as reward signal has been implemented in deterministic and probabilistic settings (Achiam and Sastry,
2017; Shelhamer et al., 2016) and is commonly
known as curiosity learning. The error reward signal encourages the exploration of unfamiliar parts
of the state-action space which are not yet wellpredictable. Pathak et al. (2017) derive the curiosity reward from an inverse dynamics model
which is simultaneously less prone to be confused
by unpredictable elements of the environment (cf.
white-noise problem (Schmidhuber, 2010)). Burda
et al. (2018b) use a randomly initialised projection
from observation into latent space and the predictor driving the learning process is tasked with
learning this projection. Huang et al. (2019) use
the error of a predictive model of penalties in dexterous manipulation and find that the additional
intrinsically motivated exploration helps in the development of gentle grasping policies. Curiosity
learning can also be seen through an information
theoretic lens using an information gain objective
like in Still and Precup (2012) or Houthooft et al.
(2016). Lastly, the disagreement between an ensemble of forward models (Pathak et al., 2019) can also
be treated as a proxy for model uncertainty and
exploited as a reward signal. In addition to serving
as a reward generator, the predictors can also be

used for targeted exploration. Lowrey et al. (2018)
and Sekar et al. (2020) employ world models to
deliberately explore in regions where the expected
prediction error is high a priori - as opposed to realising that something surprising has been observed
a posteriori like in standard curiosity approaches.
Besides curiosity learning, the literature features
an extensive body of work on structured exploration methods in reinforcement learning. Classical methods like count-based exploration schemes
have been revisited in continuous settings, e.g.
in Bellemare et al. (2016) changes in state density
estimations are used as exploration bonus rewards.
Another line of work revolves around the central notion of empowerment (Klyubin et al., 2005) which
aims to find new behaviours which are increasingly controllable by the agent (Gregor et al., 2016;
Mohamed and Rezende, 2015). The estimation of
model learning progress has also been discussed as
a reward signal for exploration but this approach is
much harder to implement as it relies on a measure
of model improvement (Lopes et al., 2012). Closely
related to model-improvement-based exploration is
the idea of PowerPlay (Schmidhuber, 2013) which
describes an inductive task proposal scheme equipping the agent with a mechanism which infers the
current frontier of soluble tasks and inductively
creates a novel task which can be solved by employing the agent’s current knowledge. However,
this exploration scheme has mostly remained conceptual so far with experiments limited to simple
pattern recognition tasks (Srivastava et al., 2013).
Related to PowerPlay’s idea of task proposition but
supposedly more tractable is the concept of selfplay (Sukhbaatar et al., 2017). In this paradigm,
two agents play a competitive game where one
player is rewarded for inventing a behaviour which
the other agent cannot imitate. This approach has
recently led to the emergence of highly complex object manipulation behaviour on a simulated robotic
arm (OpenAI et al., 2021).
The importance of diverse interactions with the
environment – similar to the playful behaviour exhibited by children – has been stressed in recent
works in reinforcement learning, e.g. in Haber
et al. (2018) or Lynch et al. (2020). Such intrinsically motivated exploration has been shown to
lead to the discovery of diverse behaviour and re-

usable skills as a natural ‘by-product’ of interacting
with the environment (Singh et al., 2005). Several recent works have identified the diversity of
behaviour as a central objective to optimise for during unsupervised exploration (Eysenbach et al.,
2018; Sharma et al., 2019). Sharma et al. (2020)
have extended this line of work and also showed
that the acquired latent ‘skill space’ can be leveraged in model-predictive control fashion for goalconditioned navigation on a real-world quadruped.
Our work builds upon the curiosity learning approach utilising the forward prediction error of a
dynamics model as a reward signal. However, in
contrast to typical curiosity setups (Burda et al.,
2018a) which are optimised on-policy we employ
an off-policy method to train the agent. Our method
is also set apart from prior art with regards to the
utilisation of self-discovered behaviour. Instead
of using model-predictive control (Sharma et al.,
2020), we leverage emergent behaviour directly by
employing policy snapshots as modular skills in a
mixture policy (Wulfmeier et al., 2020a, 2021).

3. Method
In this section, we present SelMo – a self-motivated
exploration method which optimises a curiosity
objective in an off-policy fashion. Our system is
designed around two key components: A forward
dynamics model 𝑓𝑑 𝑦𝑛 : 𝑆 × 𝐴 ↦→ 𝑆 which aims to
approximate the state transition function of the
environment and a policy 𝜋 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 ) which aims to
take transitions in the environment for which the
prediction error of 𝑓𝑑 𝑦𝑛 is high.
Given potentially different requirements for the
dynamics model and the exploration policy, the
implementation builds on two separate learning
processes. We have decided to implement the system in this distributed way to more easily realise
the data labeling process and have convenient control over learning rate and data flow parameters.
However, other implementations which fuse both
learning processes and data buffers are also conceivable. Crucially, our setup deviates from recent
on-policy approaches for curiosity-based rewards
in two important aspects: First, we optimise in an
off-policy fashion based on a diverse set of experi4

enced transitions in the environment. In this way,
the policy is encouraged to to cover a broader spectrum of exploration avenues as the learning evolves.
Second, we employ an approximate but efficient
data labelling strategy which only assigns curiosity rewards to trajectories when they are used to
update the dynamics model, but refrain from relabeling all trajectories in the policy replay after
every model update. We provide a general overview
over the whole system in fig. 2 and explain each
component in detail in the paragraphs below.

𝜏 𝑘 = (𝑠 0𝑘 , 𝑎𝑘0 , 𝑠 1𝑘 ), . . . , (𝑠𝑇𝑘 −1, 𝑎𝑇𝑘 −1, 𝑠𝑇𝑘 ) collected by

in the range [−1, 1] . Batches of training data for
the world model are sampled uniformly from this
buffer as B M := {𝜏 1, . . . , 𝜏 𝐵 } ∼ U (𝐷 M ) . In order
to preserve a diverse sampling of environment
transitions during the whole learning process,
each trajectory in 𝐷 M can be sampled at most
𝑛𝑚𝑎𝑥 times. Additionally, old trajectories in the
buffer are replaced by new ones at random when
the buffer size limit is exceeded.

World Model We describe the environment in
which the agent operates as E = (𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑃) with
state and action spaces 𝑆 and 𝐴 as well as a state
transition function 𝑠𝑡 +1 = 𝑃 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) over discrete
time steps which describes the environment’s transition dynamics. The world model is a forwardpredictive model 𝑓𝑑 𝑦𝑛 : 𝑆 × 𝐴 ↦→ 𝑆 which approximates the environment’s transition dynamics as:

𝑠ˆ𝑡 +1 = 𝑓𝑑 𝑦𝑛 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ; 𝜃 )

(1)

In our case, eq. (1) is implemented as a two-layer
MLP with parameters 𝜃 . Besides estimating the
transition dynamics from observed data, the world
model plays a crucial role in assigning the reward
for each observed transition (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1 ) . When
a transition is evaluated by the world model, the
assigned reward is scaled by the model’s current
prediction error.

𝑟 ( 𝑗) (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 , 𝑠𝑡 +1 ) = tanh (𝜂𝑟 ∗ (𝑓𝑑(𝑦𝑛
(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) − 𝑠𝑡 +1 ) 2 )

The ‘state’ of the world model is indicated by the
number of gradient updates 𝑗 which have been
performed on it so far. We scale the reward via a
hyper-parameter 𝜂𝑟 and pass it through a tanh to
keep it bounded for the downstream policy learning procedure. When a new batch of data B is
sampled from the model replay, the world model
performs two operations. First, it labels each 𝜏 ∈ B
by assigning curiosity rewards 𝑟 𝐶 according to
eq. (2). Second, it performs one gradient update

After one world model update, the relabeled batch
of trajectories B̃ is stored in the policy replay buffer
𝐷𝜋 .
Policy Replay The fixed-size policy replay 𝐷 𝜋
stores tuples (𝜏 𝑗 , 𝑟 𝑗 ) representing trajectories
which have been labeled with curiosity rewards
by the world model. This off-policy setup provides the policy learner with a diverse training
set to optimise for useful exploration actions globally and not only in the vicinity of the most recent experience. During policy learning, data
batches are sampled uniformly from this buffer
as B𝜋 := {(𝜏 1, 𝑟 1 ), . . . , (𝜏 𝐵 , 𝑟 𝐵 )} ∼ U (𝐷 𝜋 ) . Similar to the model replay, each tuple can be sampled
up to 𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑥 times to increase the utilisation of each
data point during policy learning. However, the
removal strategy of the policy replay is 𝐹 𝐼 𝐹𝑂 to
ensure that trajectories with the most outdated
curiosity rewards get replaced first to reflect the
change in the world model, albeit with a certain
delay.
Policy The Markov Decision Process (MDP) which
is induced by this setup can be written as: M ( 𝑗) =
𝑗)
(𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑃, 𝑟 ( 𝑗) ) . Since the world model 𝑓𝑑(𝑦𝑛
changes
with every gradient update, the reward function
𝑟 ( 𝑗) changes continuously. Consequently, the reward varies with the model training timesteps 𝑗
and the policy 𝜋 is required to keep adapting. The
policy replay 𝐷 𝜋 is filled by the world model’s
training loop. It contains data of the most recent

sulting policy is optimising for a mixture of MDPs
{(𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑃, 𝑟 (𝜄) | 𝜄 ∈ [ 𝑗 − 𝜅, . . . , 𝑗]}. Policy and critic
network are implemented as two separate MLPs.
The policy is optimised off-policy using MPO (Abdolmaleki et al., 2018) and a separate learning rate

4. Experiments
This section is split in two parts. First, we report
our analysis of the emergence of behaviours when
optimising only for a curiosity reward in section 4.1.
Second, we present an empirical utilisation of selfdiscovered behaviour for accelerated learning of
new downstream tasks in section 4.2. For details
regarding the simulation domains and model hyperparameters, we refer the reader to appendix A and
appendix B respectively.
4.1. Emergence of Behaviour
We start our investigation with an analysis of the
behaviour which emerges in our two simulated domains as depicted in fig. 1. The JACO domain features a 9 DoF robotic arm and two cubes; the OP3
domain features a 20 DoF humanoid robot. For
this experiment, we run the SelMo learning loop
(cf. fig. 2) with a single actor for 100K episodes
on each of the environments. During training, the
agent solely optimises its curiosity objective which
is defined by eq. (2). The visual inspection of the
experiments reveal that in both cases, diverse sets
of human-interpretable behaviour emerge consistently and are exhibited by the agent for extended
periods of time before the ever-changing curiosity reward function shifts the learning towards a
new behaviour. Below, we describe the observed
behaviours in each domain in greater detail.
Emergent Manipulation Behaviour on JACO
A qualitative example timeline of emerging behaviours on the JACO arm is depicted in fig. 1 (top)
and supplemented by a plot evaluating reaching
and lifting behaviour during the run in fig. 3. We
find that the agent is very quickly driven towards
both cubes with equal attention and starts interacting with them by pushing them around. Soon

thereafter, it discovers that pushing them up the
slanted walls of the bin facilitates picking them
up before it stably latches onto a mode in which
it prefers manipulating the red cube over the blue
one after approximately 15K episodes. This also
coincides with a first period of sustained lifting of
the red cube. We hypothesise that the discovery of
lifting said cube reinforces the interaction with it
as it opens up a new dimension along which model
prediction error can be rewarded: the height of the
object. After about 25K episodes, it has learned to
pick up an object reliably even without the help of
the slopes.
After approximately 40K episodes, the curiosity objective pushes the agent to deliberately take
objects outside of the workspace and perform pickand-place operations which move a cube over a
long distance but at a lower height. Interestingly,
the policy does not degenerate into extreme behaviours like spinning motions which have been
observed in related work (Sekar et al., 2020) but
stays focused on the objects and keeps exploring
their physical properties. For instance, at around
70K episodes, the policy investigates the stability
of cube poses in a targeted way by balancing them
on their edges and corners. Finally, after about
80K episodes, it starts exploring the possibilities of
moving both cubes simultaneously.

Emergent Locomotion Behaviour on OP3
Similar to the JACO arm, we present a timeline of
emerging behaviour on the OP3 in fig. 1 (bottom)
and a corresponding evaluation of locomotion behaviour in fig. 4. Unsurprisingly, the agent spends
roughly the first 2K episodes – indicated by the
steep rise in walking rewards – just on learning a
sense of balance because an episode is terminated
early when the torso constraint (cf. appendix A) is
violated and the agent is about to fall. This also corresponds to maximising the experienced episode
length because this increases the chances of further
increasing the accumulated reward. This finding is
in line with earlier work (Pathak et al., 2017) which
has shown that the avoidance of a ‘death’ event is
a natural by-product of curiosity-driven learning
with a positive reward and favourably shapes the
emerging policy.

Figure 3 | Manipulation task evaluation in the JACO environment over the lifetime of one experiment
while the agent is only trained on the curiosity objective (cf. eq. (2)). A snapshot of the curiosity policy
is saved every 100 episodes and evaluated on reaching and lifting the red and blue cubes respectively.
Mean and standard deviation are plotted over 20 evaluation runs per policy snapshot and the plot is
smoothed with an exponential filter of 𝜎 = 1.5.

Once the agent has learned to stay upright, it
slowly starts to develop basic locomotion in the
form of stumbling forwards and backwards with
only small foot lifting heights which is also reflected in minor oscillations during the evaluation
of the walking rewards in fig. 4. Interestingly, after
around 30K episodes, the agent has discovered to
swing its arms to take bigger steps. This is most
impressively first demonstrated after nearly 40K
episodes when the agent balances on one foot while
stretching out the other leg using its arms for counterbalancing moves. Using the arms also opens
new avenues for exploration. Approximately 40K
episodes into training, the agent has learned to
catch itself when falling backwards. This leads to
the discovery of a sit-down behaviour which does
not violate the environment’s torso constraints. After the agent has explored various ‘ground exercises’ it switches back to walking gaits at around
55K episodes. Then, the whole body movement has
become considerably more nimble and its movement repertoire now features quick turns, stumbling reflexes and even safe backward leaps. After

about 70K episodes the agent starts revisiting earlier behaviour, e.g. the balancing skill, but keeps
adding variations to it like knee-bending or stretching.
4.2. Utilisation of Emergent Behaviour
As we have discussed in the previous section, the
constantly evolving curiosity policy develops behaviours which correspond to the solution of concrete tasks (cf. fig. 3, fig. 4). In order to retain
those diverse behaviours to accelerate the learning
of new tasks, we have devised the following experiment: Assuming that the curiosity policies exhibit
undirected yet versatile exploratory behaviour, we
investigate how well they could serve as auxiliary
skills in a modular learning setup of a downstream
task.
We employ Regularized Hierarchical Policy Optimization (RHPO) (Wulfmeier et al., 2020a) as this
framework allows us to compose multiple policies
in a hierarchical manner. In each environment, we
define a downstream target task which we are inter7

Is Curiosity All You Need? On the Utility of Emergent Behaviours from Curious Exploration

Figure 4 | Task evaluation in the OP3 environment over the lifetime of one experiment while the agent
is only trained on the curiosity objective (cf. eq. (2)). A snapshot of the curiosity policy is saved every

deviation are plotted over 20 evaluation runs per policy snapshot and the plot is smoothed with an

ested in learning and provide five policy snapshots
from a SelMo experiment as auxiliary exploration
skills. During the SelMo experiment, we optimise
solely for the curiosity objective and save a snapshot of the curiosity policy every 100 episodes. The
RHPO experiment subsequently samples SelMo
policy snapshots and utilises the behaviour exhibited by them to assist the exploration for the desired
downstream task.
For this experiment, we refer again to the JACO
environment where we define the target task to
be lift_red. While the policy for the target task
is randomly initialised, the auxiliary policies are
randomly sampled from the SelMo snapshots and
kept fixed during the entire RHPO training. We
differentiate between three different phases from
which the SelMo snapshots are chosen: early comprises of snapshots which have been trained on up
to 10K episodes, mid snapshots are from the interval between 10K and 20K episodes and late
snapshots are sampled between 20K and 30K training episodes. In fig. 5 we compare the learning
progress of the downstream task with the sampled
SelMo auxiliary skills against a baseline featuring
hand-designed task curricula in an SAC-X framework (Riedmiller et al., 2018). In the case of the
JACO environment, the agent is given a curriculum
of reward functions which help to reach and move
the red cube.
In the case of lift_red on JACO, we find that
SelMo auxiliaries from the mid and late exploration periods give the learning of the lifting policy

a significant boost which is commensurate with a
tuned SAC-X baseline featuring multiple auxiliary
rewards which have been hand-designed to facilitate the learning of lift_red. This result is in line
with the performance observed in fig. 3 where the
curiosity-based policy has developed a sustained
lifting behaviour between 20K and 35K episodes.
Consequently, snapshot auxiliaries sampled from
that range are particularly useful when a targeted
lifting policy is to be learned.
This experiment shows that even a simple behaviour retention strategy like policy snapshotting can already provide clear benefits for downstream learning of new tasks. The self-discovered
behaviours from a curiosity training phase afford
a task learning scaffold which can be commensurate with a specifically designed set of auxiliary
reward functions. This is a promising result suggesting that independent curious exploration could
be used in lieu of human-engineered task curricula
in complex manipulation scenarios.

5. Discussion
Our experiments have shown that complex manipulation and locomotion behaviour such as grasping, lifting, balancing, sitting and leaping emerges
completely unsupervised in an off-policy curiosity learning setup on a 9 DoF robot arm and a
20 DoF humanoid. This observation supports our
hypothesis that self-discovered behaviour can provide a valuable skill repertoire for the learning of

new downstream tasks. We add further evidence
to this hypothesis by utilising randomly selected
policy snapshots from a curiosity training as auxiliary skills in a modular learning setup and show
that they provide a learning scaffold commensurate
with hand-designed auxiliary reward functions for
the respective tasks. This suggests that curiositybased exploration should be treated as an independent aspect of a learning system as opposed to a
mere bonus reward or policy pre-training phase.
In this study, we provide a baseline for harnessing
self-discovered behaviour by randomly sampling
policy snapshots and treating them as fixed skills
in a modular learning setup. However, more sophisticated techniques for identification, retention
and utilisation of behaviour in curious exploration
settings are conceivable and will be briefly touched
upon in this discussion section.

Identification of Emerging Behaviour As we
have shown in section 4.1, complex behaviour can
emerge in an unsupervised way when optimising
a policy for a curiosity objective. However, it is
revealed in fig. 3 and fig. 4 that pre-conceived reward functions are only able to capture a fraction of
the emergent behaviour like reaching and lifting of
individual objects or basic walking gaits. More involved behaviours are not covered by basic reward
functions and implementing reward functions to
identify a broad set of behaviour a priori does not
scale well with the unsupervised nature of curiosity
learning. Diversity-based approaches (Eysenbach

et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2019, 2020) address this
challenge via a latent ‘skill space’ which modulates
the policy network to capture different modes of
operation like jumping and walking. The temporal
and hierarchical abstraction provided by the latent
vector also facilitates planning over the skill space.
However, the identification of particularly useful
skills worth retaining and comparatively useless
skills which could be overwritten is still an open
question, especially in never-ending learning settings where a curiosity-driven exploration keeps
discovering new behaviours or revisiting old ones.

Retention and Utilisation of Self-Discovered Behaviour Closely related to the question of behaviour identification is the question of its retention
and utilisation. In our setup we have treated snapshots of the same curiosity policy as different skills
as they represent different behaviour over time. Using a latent skill space as an arbiter for different
behaviours in the same policy network (Eysenbach
et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2019) has also been
shown to work effectively as this formulation also
enables planning over the learned space of skills.
However, Lynch et al. (2020) have also demonstrated the utility of raw play data in the training
of versatile goal-conditioned policies which would
position the curiosity-driven exploration as a data
collector for a downstream policy distillation instead of a re-usable behaviour in itself. Lastly, Riedmiller et al. (2018) and Hertweck et al. (2020)
have shown the benefits of curricula of reward

functions for the learning of complex manipulation
tasks which opens another avenue for the utilisation of curiosity-based learning: Instead of using
frozen snapshots of the policy as a repertoire of
skills one could also treat different versions of the
world model as a set of distinct reward functions to
encourage the optimisation for diverse behaviour
during learning of new downstream tasks.

6. Conclusion
In this paper we have studied the emerging behaviour when optimising an exploration policy
for a curiosity objective derived from a forwardpredictive world model. To this end, we have presented SelMo, a curiosity-based, off-policy exploration method and applied it in two continuous
control domains: a simulated robotic arm and humanoid robot. We have observed that complex
behaviour emerges in both settings and provided
a baseline for the utilisation of this self-discovered
behaviour in a modular downstream learning scenario. Despite the remaining technical challenges,
we believe that the automatic identification and retention of useful emerging behaviour from curious
exploration is a fruitful avenue of future investigation in unsupervised reinforcement learning.

A. Simulation Environments

A.1. JACO Manipulation Environment

In this section we provide details about the two
robotic simulation domains used in our experiments.

This environment is designed to study manipulation tasks like object lifting and stacking with a
robotic arm (cf. fig. 6). The state observation space
consists of 72 dimensions: 24 features are used to
represent the robot’s proprioception as well as the
state of each object. The action space spans 9 dimensions: 6 concerning the arm and 3 concerning
the three-point gripper. A detailed description of
the environment is provided in table 1. Interactions
with the two objects (O1 = red cube, O2 = blue
cube) are evaluated using the sparse reward functions reach_{red,blue} and lift_{red,blue}.
Each episode in this environment lasts 20 seconds
or 400 control timesteps.

about to fall over.

A.2. OP3 Locomotion Environment
This environment is designed to study locomotion
with a humanoid robot (cf. fig. 7). The state observation consists of 49 proprioceptive features.
The 20-dimensional action space controls the orientations of the robot’s head, ankle, elbow, hip,
knee and shoulder. Actions passed to the robot
are smoothed with an exponential filter to reduce
motion jerk. A detailed description of the environment is provided in table 2. The robot always
spawns in a standing, upright position. Locomotion is evaluated by the dense reward functions
walk_{forward,backward} for forward and back13

The size_action is different for each environment
(cf. appendix A). The policy is optimised using
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate
of 𝜂𝜋 = 3𝑒 − 4. The reward scale is set to 𝜂𝑟 = 10.0
across all experiments.

this environment lasts 10 seconds or 200 control
timesteps. If the robot’s hip angle deviates more
than 15◦ from an upright orientation, the simulation terminates early effectively preventing the
robot from falling over.

B. Model and Training Details
Across all experiments with the SelMo architecture,
we consistently use the following hyper-parameters
and model architectures. Each SelMo experiment
is run with a single actor for 𝑁 = 1𝑒 5 episodes.
World Model 𝑓𝑑 𝑦𝑛 The world model is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
with the following layer sizes and activation functions: [FC(256), elu(·), FC(256),
elu(·), FC(size_state)] For each environment,
size_state is the sum of the dimensions for
proprioception and perception (cf. appendix A).
The world model is optimised using Adam (Kingma
and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 𝜂 M = 3𝑒 − 4.
