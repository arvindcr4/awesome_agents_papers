**TITLE:** JaxRobotarium: Training and Deploying Multi-Robot Policies in 10 Minutes
**ARXIV_ID:** 2505.06771v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** JaxRobotarium is a platform for multi-robot reinforcement learning (MRRL) that allows for rapid training and deployment of policies. It provides a standardized set of multi-robot coordination scenarios, a Jax-based simulator, and a learning interface for integrating with existing MARL libraries. The platform is designed to bridge the gap between the Robotarium hardware testbed and modern MARL algorithms.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* JaxRobotarium provides a standardized platform for MRRL research, allowing for easy comparison and benchmarking of different algorithms.
* The platform includes a Jax-based simulator that supports parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, enabling fast training and simulation of multi-robot policies.
* JaxRobotarium provides a set of pre-implemented scenarios, including Arctic Transport, Discovery, Material Transport, Warehouse, Navigation, Foraging, Predator Prey, and Continuous-RWARE, which can be used to evaluate the performance of different MRRL algorithms.
* The platform allows for seamless deployment of trained policies on the Robotarium hardware testbed, enabling sim2real evaluation and validation of MRRL algorithms.
