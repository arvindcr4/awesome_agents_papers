**ARXIV_ID:** Not provided
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (although it's more related to multi-agent reinforcement learning, I chose this category as it's the closest match)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** NQMIX is a novel actor-critic method that extends QMIX by introducing an off-policy policy gradient, removing the monotonicity constraint, and using a state-value as the learning target. This allows for non-monotonic value function factorization, which can improve performance in complex multi-agent environments.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* NQMIX introduces an off-policy policy gradient to QMIX, allowing for more flexible and efficient learning.
* NQMIX removes the monotonicity constraint of QMIX, enabling the representation of a wider range of joint action-value functions.
* NQMIX uses a state-value as the learning target, which can help avoid overestimation of the learning target.
* NQMIX can be extended to continuous action space settings using deterministic policy gradients.
