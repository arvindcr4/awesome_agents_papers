Abstract
We explore deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent domains. We
begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case:
Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while
policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows.
We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies
of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multiagent coordination. Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an
ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies.
We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative
as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover
various physical and informational coordination strategies.

Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to solve challenging problems, from game
playing [24, 29] to robotics [18]. In industrial applications, RL is emerging as a practical component
in large scale systems such as data center cooling [1]. Most of the successes of RL have been in
single agent domains, where modelling or predicting the behaviour of other actors in the environment
is largely unnecessary.
However, there are a number of important applications that involve interaction between multiple
agents, where emergent behavior and complexity arise from agents co-evolving together. For example,
multi-robot control [21], the discovery of communication and language [31, 8, 25], multiplayer games
[28], and the analysis of social dilemmas [17] all operate in a multi-agent domain. Related problems,
such as variants of hierarchical reinforcement learning [6] can also be seen as a multi-agent system,
with multiple levels of hierarchy being equivalent to multiple agents. Additionally, multi-agent
self-play has recently been shown to be a useful training paradigm [29, 32]. Successfully scaling RL
to environments with multiple agents is crucial to building artificially intelligent systems that can
productively interact with humans and each other.
Unfortunately, traditional reinforcement learning approaches such as Q-Learning or policy gradient
are poorly suited to multi-agent environments. One issue is that each agent’s policy is changing
as training progresses, and the environment becomes non-stationary from the perspective of any
individual agent (in a way that is not explainable by changes in the agent’s own policy). This presents
learning stability challenges and prevents the straightforward use of past experience replay, which is

crucial for stabilizing deep Q-learning. Policy gradient methods, on the other hand, usually exhibit
very high variance when coordination of multiple agents is required. Alternatively, one can use modelbased policy optimization which can learn optimal policies via back-propagation, but this requires
a (differentiable) model of the world dynamics and assumptions about the interactions between
agents. Applying these methods to competitive environments is also challenging from an optimization
perspective, as evidenced by the notorious instability of adversarial training methods [11].
In this work, we propose a general-purpose multi-agent learning algorithm that: (1) leads to learned
policies that only use local information (i.e. their own observations) at execution time, (2) does
not assume a differentiable model of the environment dynamics or any particular structure on the
communication method between agents, and (3) is applicable not only to cooperative interaction
but to competitive or mixed interaction involving both physical and communicative behavior. The
ability to act in mixed cooperative-competitive environments may be critical for intelligent agents;
while competitive training provides a natural curriculum for learning [32], agents must also exhibit
cooperative behavior (e.g. with humans) at execution time.
We adopt the framework of centralized training with decentralized execution, allowing the policies
to use extra information to ease training, so long as this information is not used at test time. It is
unnatural to do this with Q-learning without making additional assumptions about the structure of the
environment, as the Q function generally cannot contain different information at training and test
time. Thus, we propose a simple extension of actor-critic policy gradient methods where the critic is
augmented with extra information about the policies of other agents, while the actor only has access
to local information. After training is completed, only the local actors are used at execution phase,
acting in a decentralized manner and equally applicable in cooperative and competitive settings.
Since the centralized critic function explicitly uses the decision-making policies of other agents, we
additionally show that agents can learn approximate models of other agents online and effectively use
them in their own policy learning procedure. We also introduce a method to improve the stability of
multi-agent policies by training agents with an ensemble of policies, thus requiring robust interaction
with a variety of collaborator and competitor policies. We empirically show the success of our
approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent
populations are able to discover complex physical and communicative coordination strategies.

Related Work

The simplest approach to learning in multi-agent settings is to use independently learning agents.
This was attempted with Q-learning in [36], but does not perform well in practice [23]. As we will
show, independently-learning policy gradient methods also perform poorly. One issue is that each
agent’s policy changes during training, resulting in a non-stationary environment and preventing the
naïve application of experience replay. Previous work has attempted to address this by inputting
other agent’s policy parameters to the Q function [37], explicitly adding the iteration index to the
replay buffer, or using importance sampling [9]. Deep Q-learning approaches have previously been
investigated in [35] to train competing Pong agents.
The nature of interaction between agents can either be cooperative, competitive, or both and many
algorithms are designed only for a particular nature of interaction. Most studied are cooperative
settings, with strategies such as optimistic and hysteretic Q function updates [15, 22, 26], which
assume that the actions of other agents are made to improve collective reward. Another approach is to
indirectly arrive at cooperation via sharing of policy parameters [12], but this requires homogeneous
agent capabilities. These algorithms are generally not applicable in competitive or mixed settings.
See [27, 4] for surveys of multi-agent learning approaches and applications.
Concurrently to our work, [7] proposed a similar idea of using policy gradient methods with a
centralized critic, and test their approach on a StarCraft micromanagement task. Their approach
differs from ours in the following ways: (1) they learn a single centralized critic for all agents, whereas
we learn a centralized critic for each agent, allowing for agents with differing reward functions
including competitive scenarios, (2) we consider environments with explicit communication between
agents, (3) they combine recurrent policies with feed-forward critics, whereas our experiments
use feed-forward policies (although our methods are applicable to recurrent policies), (4) we learn
continuous policies whereas they learn discrete policies.
2

Recent work has focused on learning grounded cooperative communication protocols between agents
to solve various tasks [31, 8, 25]. However, these methods are usually only applicable when the
communication between agents is carried out over a dedicated, differentiable communication channel.
Our method requires explicitly modeling decision-making process of other agents. The importance
of such modeling has been recognized by both reinforcement learning [3, 5] and cognitive science
communities [10]. [13] stressed the importance of being robust to the decision making process of
other agents, as do others by building Bayesian models of decision making. We incorporate such
robustness considerations by requiring that agents interact successfully with an ensemble of any
possible policies of other agents, improving training stability and robustness of agents after training.

Background

Markov Games In this work, we consider a multi-agent extension of Markov decision processes
(MDPs) called partially observable Markov games [20]. A Markov game for N agents is defined by a
set of states S describing the possible configurations of all agents, a set of actions A1 , ..., AN and
a set of observations O1 , ..., ON for each agent. To choose actions, each agent i uses a stochastic
policy π θi : Oi × Ai 7→ [0, 1], which produces the next state according to the state transition function
T : S × A1 × ... × AN 7→ S.2 Each agent i obtains rewards as a function of the state and agent’s
action ri : S × Ai 7→ R, and receives a private observation correlated with the state oi : S 7→ Oi .
The initial states are determined by a distribution ρ : S 7→ [0, 1]. Each agent i aims to maximize its
PT
own total expected return Ri = t=0 γ t rit where γ is a discount factor and T is the time horizon.
Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). Q-Learning and DQN [24] are popular methods in
reinforcement learning and have been previously applied to multi-agent settings [8, 37]. Q-Learning
makes use of an action-value function for policy π as Qπ (s, a) = E[R|st = s, at = a]. This Q
function can be recursively rewritten as Qπ (s, a) = Es0 [r(s, a) + γEa0 ∼π [Qπ (s0 , a0 )]]. DQN learns
the action-value function Q∗ corresponding to the optimal policy by minimizing the loss:
L(θ) = Es,a,r,s0 [(Q∗ (s, a|θ) − y)2 ],

where

y = r + γ max
Q̄∗ (s0 , a0 ),

a

(1)

where Q̄ is a target Q function whose parameters are periodically updated with the most recent
θ, which helps stabilize learning. Another crucial component of stabilizing DQN is the use of an
experience replay buffer D containing tuples (s, a, r, s0 ).
Q-Learning can be directly applied to multi-agent settings by having each agent i learn an independently optimal function Qi [36]. However, because agents are independently updating their
policies as learning progresses, the environment appears non-stationary from the view of any one
agent, violating Markov assumptions required for convergence of Q-learning. Another difficulty
observed in [9] is that the experience replay buffer cannot be used in such a setting since in general,
P (s0 |s, a, π 1 , ..., π N ) 6= P (s0 |s, a, π 01 , ..., π 0N ) when any π i 6= π 0i .
Policy Gradient (PG) Algorithms. Policy gradient methods are another popular choice for a
variety of RL tasks. The main idea is to directly adjust the parameters θ of the policy in order to
maximize the objective J(θ) = Es∼pπ ,a∼π θ [R] by taking steps in the direction of ∇θ J(θ). Using
the Q function defined previously, the gradient of the policy can be written as [34]:
∇θ J(θ) = Es∼pπ ,a∼π θ [∇θ log π θ (a|s)Qπ (s, a)],

(2)

π

where p is the state distribution. The policy gradient theorem has given rise to several practical
algorithms, which often differ in how they estimate Qπ . For example, one can simply use a sample
PT
return Rt = i=t γ i−t ri , which leads to the REINFORCE algorithm [39]. Alternatively, one could
learn an approximation of the true action-value function Qπ (s, a) by e.g. temporal-difference learning
[33]; this Qπ (s, a) is called the critic and leads to a variety of actor-critic algorithms [33].
Policy gradient methods are known to exhibit high variance gradient estimates. This is exacerbated
in multi-agent settings; since an agent’s reward usually depends on the actions of many agents,
the reward conditioned only on the agent’s own actions (when the actions of other agents are not
considered in the agent’s optimization process) exhibits much more variability, thereby increasing the

variance of its gradients. Below, we show a simple setting where the probability of taking a gradient
step in the correct direction decreases exponentially with the number of agents.
Proposition 1. Consider N agents with binary actions: P (ai = 1) = θi , where R(a1 , . . . , aN ) =
1a1 =···=aN . We assume an uninformed scenario, in which agents are initialized to θi = 0.5 ∀i. Then,
if we are estimating the gradient of the cost J with policy gradient, we have:

P (h∇J,
ˆ is the policy gradient estimator from a single sample, and ∇J is the true gradient.
where ∇J
Proof. See Appendix.
The use of baselines, such as value function baselines typically used to ameliorate high variance, is
problematic in multi-agent settings due to the non-stationarity issues mentioned previously.
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) Algorithms. It is also possible to extend the policy gradient
framework to deterministic policies µθ : S 7→ A [30]. In particular, under certain conditions we can
write the gradient of the objective J(θ) = Es∼pµ [R(s, a)] as:
∇θ J(θ) = Es∼D [∇θµ θ (a|s)∇a Qµ (s, a)|a=µ θ (s) ]

(3)

µ

Since this theorem relies on ∇a Q (s, a), it requires that the action space A (and thus the policy µ )
be continuous.
Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) [19] is a variant of DPG where the policy µ and critic
Qµ are approximated with deep neural networks. DDPG is an off-policy algorithm, and samples
trajectories from a replay buffer of experiences that are stored throughout training. DDPG also makes
use of a target network, as in DQN [24].

More concretely, consider a game with N agents with policies parameterized by θ = {θ1 , ..., θN },
and let π = {π 1 , ..., π N } be the set of all agent policies. Then we can write the gradient of the

∇θi J(θi ) = Es∼pµ ,ai ∼π i [∇θi log π i (ai |oi )Qπi (x, a1 , ..., aN )].

Similarly to [8], we accomplish our goal by adopting the framework of centralized training with
decentralized execution. Thus, we allow the policies to use extra information to ease training, so
long as this information is not used at test time. It is unnatural to do this with Q-learning, as the Q
function generally cannot contain different information at training and test time. Thus, we propose
a simple extension of actor-critic policy gradient methods where the critic is augmented with extra
information about the policies of other agents.

and (3) we do not assume any particular structure on
the communication method between agents (that is, we don’t assume a differentiable communication
channel). Fulfilling the above desiderata would provide a general-purpose multi-agent learning
algorithm that could be applied not just to cooperative games with explicit communication channels,
but competitive games and games involving only physical interactions between agents.

Here Qπi (x, a1 , ..., aN ) is a centralized action-value function that takes as input the actions of all
agents, a1 , . . . , aN , in addition to some state information x, and outputs the Q-value for agent i. In
the simplest case, x could consist of the observations of all agents, x = (o1 , ..., oN ), however we
could also include additional state information if available. Since each Qπi is learned separately,
agents can have arbitrary reward structures, including conflicting rewards in a competitive setting.
We can extend the above idea to work with deterministic policies. If we now consider N continuous
policies µ θi w.r.t. parameters θi (abbreviated as µ i ), the gradient can be written as:
µ

∇θi J(µ i ) = Ex,a∼D [∇θi µ i (ai |oi )∇ai Qµi (x, a1 , ..., aN )|ai =µµi (oi ) ],

As shown in
Section 5, we find the centralized critic with deterministic policies works very well in practice, and
refer to it as multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). We provide the description
of the full algorithm in the Appendix.
A primary motivation behind MADDPG is that, if we know the actions taken by all agents, the
environment is stationary even as the policies change, since P (s0 |s, a1 , ..., aN , π 1 , ..., π N ) =
P (s0 |s, a1 , ..., aN ) = P (s0 |s, a1 , ..., aN , π 01 , ..., π 0N ) for any π i 6= π 0i . This is not the case if we
do not explicitly condition on the actions of other agents, as done for most traditional RL methods.
Note that we require the policies of other agents to apply an update in Eq. 6. Knowing the observations
and policies of other agents is not a particularly restrictive assumption; if our goal is to train agents to
exhibit complex communicative behaviour in simulation, this information is often available to all
agents. However, we can relax this assumption if necessary by learning the policies of other agents
from observations — we describe a method of doing this in Section 4.2.

Inferring Policies of Other Agents

To remove the assumption of knowing other agents’ policies, as required in Eq. 6, each agent i
can additionally maintain an approximation µ̂ φj (where φ are the parameters of the approximation;
i

henceforth µ̂ ji ) to the true policy of agent j, µ j . This approximate policy is learned by maximizing
the log probability of agent j’s actions, with an entropy regularizer:

L(φji ) = −Eoj ,aj log µ̂ ji (aj |oj ) + λH(µ̂ ji ) ,

where H is the entropy of the policy distribution. With the approximate policies, y in Eq. 6 can be
replaced by an approximate value ŷ calculated as follows:

in a completely online fashion: before updating Qi , the centralized Q function, we take the latest
samples of each agent j from the replay buffer to perform a single gradient step to update φji . Note
also that, in the above equation, we input the action log probabilities of each agent directly into Q,
rather than sampling.
4.3

Agents with Policy Ensembles

As previously mentioned, a recurring problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning is the environment non-stationarity due to the agents’ changing policies. This is particularly true in competitive
settings, where agents can derive a strong policy by overfitting to the behavior of their competitors.
Such policies are undesirable as they are brittle and may fail when the competitors alter strategies.
To obtain multi-agent policies that are more robust to changes in the policy of competing agents,
we propose to train a collection of K different sub-policies. At each episode, we randomly select
one particular sub-policy for each agent to execute. Suppose that policy µi is an ensemble of K

different sub-policies with sub-policy k denoted by µ θ(k) (denoted as µ i ). For agent i, we are then

Since different sub-policies will be executed in different episodes, we maintain a replay buffer Di

Environments

To perform our experiments, we adopt the grounded communication environment proposed in [25]3 ,
which consists of N agents and L landmarks inhabiting a two-dimensional world with continuous
space and discrete time. Agents may take physical actions in the environment and communication
actions that get broadcasted to other agents. Unlike [25], we do not assume that all agents have
identical action and observation spaces, or act according to the same policy π . We also consider
games that are both cooperative (all agents must maximize a shared return) and competitive (agents
have conflicting goals). Some environments require explicit communication between agents in order
to achieve the best reward, while in other environments agents can only perform physical actions. We
provide details for each environment below.

Cooperative communication. This task consists of two cooperative agents, a speaker and a listener,
who are placed in an environment with three landmarks of differing colors. At each episode, the
listener must navigate to a landmark of a particular color, and obtains reward based on its distance
to the correct landmark. However, while the listener can observe the relative position and color
of the landmarks, it does not know which landmark it must navigate to. Conversely, the speaker’s
observation consists of the correct landmark color, and it can produce a communication output at
each time step which is observed by the listener. Thus, the speaker must learn to output the landmark
colour based on the motions of the listener. Although this problem is relatively simple, as we show in
Section 5.2 it poses a significant challenge to traditional RL algorithms.
Cooperative navigation. In this environment, agents must cooperate through physical actions to
reach a set of L landmarks. Agents observe the relative positions of other agents and landmarks, and
are collectively rewarded based on the proximity of any agent to each landmark. In other words, the
agents have to ‘cover’ all of the landmarks. Further, the agents occupy significant physical space and
are penalized when colliding with each other. Our agents learn to infer the landmark they must cover,
and move there while avoiding other agents.
Keep-away. This scenario consists of L landmarks including a target landmark, N cooperating
agents who know the target landmark and are rewarded based on their distance to the target, and M
adversarial agents who must prevent the cooperating agents from reaching the target. Adversaries

accomplish this by physically pushing the agents away from the landmark, temporarily occupying it.
While the adversaries are also rewarded based on their distance to the target landmark, they do not
know the correct target; this must be inferred from the movements of the agents.
Physical deception. Here, N agents cooperate to reach a single target landmark from a total of N
landmarks. They are rewarded based on the minimum distance of any agent to the target (so only one
agent needs to reach the target landmark). However, a lone adversary also desires to reach the target
landmark; the catch is that the adversary does not know which of the landmarks is the correct one.
Thus the cooperating agents, who are penalized based on the adversary distance to the target, learn to
spread out and cover all landmarks so as to deceive the adversary.
Predator-prey. In this variant of the classic predator-prey game, N slower cooperating agents
must chase the faster adversary around a randomly generated environment with L large landmarks
impeding the way. Each time the cooperative agents collide with an adversary, the agents are rewarded
while the adversary is penalized. Agents observe the relative positions and velocities of the agents,
and the positions of the landmarks.
Covert communication. This is an adversarial communication environment, where a speaker agent
(‘Alice’) must communicate a message to a listener agent (‘Bob’), who must reconstruct the message
at the other end. However, an adversarial agent (‘Eve’) is also observing the channel, and wants to
reconstruct the message — Alice and Bob are penalized based on Eve’s reconstruction, and thus
Alice must encode her message using a randomly generated key, known only to Alice and Bob. This
is similar to the cryptography environment considered in [2].

Comparison to Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Methods

We implement our MADDPG algorithm and
evaluate it on the environments presented in
Section 5.1. Unless otherwise specified, our
policies are parameterized by a two-layer ReLU
MLP with 64 units per layer. The messages
sent between agents are soft approximations to
discrete messages, calculated using the GumbelSoftmax estimator [14]. To evaluate the quality
of policies learned in competitive settings, we
pitch MADDPG agents against DDPG agents,
and compare the resulting success of the agents
and adversaries in the environment. We train
our models until convergence, and then evaluate Figure 4: Agent reward on cooperative communithem by averaging various metrics for 1000 fur- cation after 25000 episodes.
ther iterations. We provide the tables and details
of our results on all environments in the Appendix, and summarize them here.
We first examine the cooperative communication scenario. Despite the simplicity of the task (the
speaker only needs to learn to output its observation), traditional RL methods such as DQN, Actor7

Figure 5: Comparison between MADDPG (left) and DDPG (right) on the cooperative communication
(CC) and physical deception (PD) environments at t = 0, 5, and 25. Small dark circles indicate
landmarks. In CC, the grey agent is the speaker, and the color of the listener indicates the target
landmark. In PD, the blue agents are trying to deceive the red adversary, while covering the target
landmark (in green). MADDPG learns the correct behavior in both cases: in CC the speaker learns
to output the target landmark color to direct the listener, while in PD the agents learn to cover both
landmarks to confuse the adversary. DDPG (and other RL algorithms) struggles in these settings:
in CC the speaker always repeats the same utterance and the listener moves to the middle of the
landmarks, and in PP one agent greedily pursues the green landmark (and is followed by the adversary)
while the othe agent scatters. See video for full trajectories.
Critic, a first-order implementation of TRPO, and DDPG all fail to learn the correct behaviour
(measured by whether the listener is within a short distance from the target landmark). In practice we
observed that the listener learns to ignore the speaker and simply moves to the middle of all observed
landmarks. We plot the learning curves over 25000 episodes for various approaches in Figure 4.
We hypothesize that a primary reason for the failure of traditional RL methods in this (and other)
multi-agent settings is the lack of a consistent gradient signal. For example, if the speaker utters
the correct symbol while the listener moves in the wrong direction, the speaker is penalized. This
problem is exacerbated as the number of time steps grows: we observed that traditional policy
gradient methods can learn when the objective of the listener is simply to reconstruct the observation
of the speaker in a single time step, or if the initial positions of agents and landmarks are fixed and
evenly distributed. This indicates that many of the multi-agent methods previously proposed for
scenarios with short time horizons (e.g. [16]) may not generalize to more complex tasks.
Conversely, MADDPG agents can learn coordinated behaviour more easily via the centralized
critic. In the cooperative communication environment, MADDPG is able to reliably learn
the correct listener and speaker policies, and
the listener is often (84.0% of the time) able to
navigate to the target.
A similar situation arises for the physical deception task: when the cooperating agents are
trained with MADDPG, they are able to successfully deceive the adversary by covering all of the
landmarks around 94% of the time when L = 2

contrasts sharply with the behaviour learned by
the cooperating DDPG agents, who are unable to deceive MADDPG adversaries in any scenario, and
do not even deceive other DDPG agents when L = 4.
While the cooperative navigation and predator-prey tasks have a less stark divide between success and
failure, in both cases the MADDPG agents outperform the DDPG agents. In cooperative navigation,
MADDPG agents have a slightly smaller average distance to each landmark, but have almost half the

DDPG out-performs Eve in terms of reconstructing Alice’s message. However, Bob trained with
MADDPG achieves a larger relative success rate compared with DDPG (52.4% to 25.1%). Further,
only Alice trained with MADDPG can encode her message such that Eve achieves near-random
reconstruction accuracy. The learning curve (a sample plot is shown in Appendix) shows that the
oscillation due to the competitive nature of the environment often cannot be overcome with common
decentralized RL methods. We emphasize that we do not use any of the tricks required for the
cryptography environment from [2], including modifying Eve’s loss function, alternating agent and
adversary training, and using a hybrid ‘mix & transform’ feed-forward and convolutional architecture.

Effect of Learning Polices of Other Agents

We evaluate the effectiveness of learning the policies of other agents in the cooperative communication
environment, following the same hyperparameters as the previous experiments and setting λ = 0.001
in Eq. 7. The results are shown in Figure 7. We observe that despite not fitting the policies of other
agents perfectly (in particular, the approximate listener policy learned by the speaker has a fairly
large KL divergence to the true policy), learning with approximated policies is able to achieve the
same success rate as using the true policy, without a significant slowdown in convergence.
5.4

Effect of Training with Policy Ensembles

We focus on the effectiveness of policy ensembles in competitive environments, including keep-away,
cooperative navigation, and predator-prey. We choose K = 3 sub-policies for the keep-away and
cooperative navigation environments, and K = 2 for predator-prey. To improve convergence speed,
we enforce that the cooperative agents should have the same policies at each episode, and similarly
for the adversaries. To evaluate the approach, we measure the performance of ensemble policies
and single policies in the roles of both agent and adversary. The results are shown on the right side
of Figure 3. We observe that agents with policy ensembles are stronger than those with a single
policy. In particular, when pitting ensemble agents against single policy adversaries (second to left
bar cluster), the ensemble agents outperform the adversaries by a large margin compared to when the
roles are reversed (third to left bar cluster).

Conclusions and Future Work

We have proposed a multi-agent policy gradient algorithm where agents learn a centralized critic
based on the observations and actions of all agents. Empirically, our method outperforms traditional
RL algorithms on a variety of cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. We can further
9

improve the performance of our method by training agents with an ensemble of policies, an approach
we believe to be generally applicable to any multi-agent algorithm.
One downside to our approach is that the input space of Q grows linearly (depending on what
information is contained in x) with the number of agents N . This could be remedied in practice by,
for example, having a modular Q function that only considers agents in a certain neighborhood of a
given agent. We leave this investigation to future work.

Experimental Results
In all of our experiments, we use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and τ = 0.01 for
updating the target networks. γ is set to be 0.95. The size of the replay buffer is 106 and we update
the network parameters after every 100 samples added to the replay buffer. We use a batch size of
1024 episodes before making an update, except for TRPO where we found a batch size of 50 lead to
better performance (allowing it more updates relative to MADDPG). We train with 10 random seeds
for environments with stark success/ fail conditions (cooperative communication, physical deception,
and covert communication) and 3 random seeds for the other environments.
The details of the experimental results are shown in the following tables.

outside the target landmark on some episodes, and conversely agents who learn to go to the middle of
the landmarks occasionally stumble upon the correct landmark.

Variance of Policy Gradient Algorithms in a Simple Multi-Agent Setting
To analyze the variance of policy gradient methods in multi-agent settings, we consider a simple
cooperative scenario with N agents and binary actions: P (ai = 1) = θi . We define the reward to be
1 if all actions are the same a1 = a2 = . . . = aN , and 0 otherwise. This is a simple scenario with

no temporal component: agents must simply learn to either always output 1 or always output 0 at
each time step. Despite this, we can show that the probability of taking a gradient step in the correct
direction decreases exponentially with the number of agents N .
Proposition 1. Consider N agents with binary actions: P (ai = 1) = θi , where R(a1 , . . . , aN ) =
1a1 =···=aN . We assume an uninformed scenario, in which agents are initialized to θi = 0.5 ∀i. Then,
if we are estimating the gradient of the cost J with policy gradient, we have:

Proof. We can write P (ai ) = θi ai (1 − θi )1−ai , and log P (ai ) = ai log θi + (1 − ai ) log(1 − θi ).

While this is a somewhat artificial example, it serves to illustrate that there are simple environments
that become progressively more difficult (in terms of the probability of taking a gradient step
in a direction that increases reward) for policy gradient methods as the number of agents grows.
This is particularly true in environments with sparse rewards, such as the one described above.

is that we remove a source of uncertainty; conditioned only on the agent’s own actions, there is
significant variability associated with the actions of other agents, which is largely removed when
using these actions as input to the critic.
