**Paper Title:** Graphon Mean-Field Control for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Yuanquan Hu, Xiaoli Wei, Junji Yan, Hengxi Zhang

**Research Method:** 07_model_based_rl (Model-Based Reinforcement Learning)

**Method Description:** The authors propose a graphon mean-field control (GMFC) framework for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) on dense graphs. They show that GMFC can be reformulated as a new Markov decision process (MDP) with deterministic dynamics and infinite-dimensional state-action space. The authors also introduce a smaller class of GMFC called block GMFC by discretizing the graphon index, which can be recast as a new MDP with deterministic dynamic and finite-dimensional continuous state-action space.

**Key Contributions:**

* The authors propose a GMFC framework for cooperative MARL on dense graphs.
* They show that GMFC can be reformulated as a new MDP with deterministic dynamics and infinite-dimensional state-action space.
* They introduce a smaller class of GMFC called block GMFC by discretizing the graphon index.
* They provide theoretical guarantees for the approximation error of GMFC and block GMFC.
