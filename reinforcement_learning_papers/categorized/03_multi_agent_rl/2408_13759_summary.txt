**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel method to improve locomotion for a single quadruped robot using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Each leg of the quadruped robot is treated as an individual agent, and the locomotion learning is modeled as a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. The proposed approach, called Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Single Quadruped Robot Locomotion (MASQ), uses a shared-parameter actor network and a centralized critic network within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
