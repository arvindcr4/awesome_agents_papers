**TITLE:** Conservative and Risk-Aware Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

**ARXIV_ID:** 2402.08421v2 [cs.LG]

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheme that integrates distributional RL and conservative Q-learning to address the epistemic uncertainty arising from the use of offline data. The proposed scheme, referred to as multi-agent conservative quantile regression (MA-CQR), supports optimizing risk-sensitive design criteria such as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR).

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a novel offline MARL scheme, MA-CQR, that integrates distributional RL and conservative Q-learning.
* Develops two variants of MA-CQR, namely MA-CIQR and MA-CCQR, which apply independent and centralized training frameworks, respectively.
* Evaluates the proposed schemes on the trajectory optimization problem in UAV networks, showcasing their advantages in avoiding risky trajectories and providing the best worst-case performance.
* Demonstrates the ability of MA-CQR to learn risk-sensitive policies that avoid entering risk regions while maintaining a comparable average return as its risk-neutral counterpart.
