Abstract Snippet:
1  Comprehensive Survey of Reinforcement Learning: From Algorithms to Practical Challenges arXiv:2411.18892v2 [cs.AI] 1 Feb 2025  Majid Ghasemi†,1 , Amir Hossein Moosavi1 , and Dariush Ebrahimi1  Abstract—Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm in Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling agents to learn optimal behaviors through interactions with their environments. Drawing from the foundations of trial and error, RL equips agents to make informed decisions through feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of RL, meticulously ...
