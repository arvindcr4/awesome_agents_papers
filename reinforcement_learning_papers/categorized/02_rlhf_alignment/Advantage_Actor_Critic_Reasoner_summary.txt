* **Title**: Advantage Actor-Critic with Reasoner: Explaining the Agent’s Behavior from an Exploratory Perspective
* **Research Method**: 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback Alignment)
* **Method Description**: This paper proposes a novel approach to interpreting the agent's behavior in reinforcement learning, called Advantage Actor-Critic with Reasoner (A2CR). A2CR consists of three interconnected networks: the Policy Network, the Value Network, and the Reasoner Network. The Reasoner Network provides an interpretation of the agent's actions by predicting the purpose of the actor's action, taking into account the state differences, state values, and rewards after each action.
* **Key Contributions**:
	+ A2CR provides a more transparent model for the agent's decision-making process.
	+ A2CR can be combined with other interpretation techniques.
	+ A2CR provides action purpose-based saliency maps for RL agents.
	+ The Reasoner Network automates its training data collection by dynamically adapting to new scenarios.
	+ The paper demonstrates the statistical convergence of the training label proportions during training.
