Abstract Snippet:
Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor  arXiv:1801.01290v2 [cs.LG] 8 Aug 2018  Tuomas Haarnoja 1 Aurick Zhou 1 Pieter Abbeel 1 Sergey Levine 1  Abstract Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such ...
