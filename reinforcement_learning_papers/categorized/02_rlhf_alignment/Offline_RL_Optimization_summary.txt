**PAPER:** OGBench: Benchmarking Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** OGBench: Benchmarking Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** OGBench is a benchmark for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) that consists of 8 types of environments, 85 datasets, and reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms. The benchmark is designed to evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms in terms of stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and handling high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduced a new benchmark for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (OGBench)
* Provided 8 types of environments and 85 datasets for evaluating offline GCRL algorithms
* Included reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms
* Designed tasks to challenge stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and handling high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity
* Enabled evaluation of offline GCRL algorithms in a standardized and comprehensive way
