Introduction  arXiv:2410.11234v3 [cs.LG] 11 Nov 2025  Abstract  The success of RL typically relies on large amounts of interactions with the environment. However, in real-world scenarios, such interactions can be unsafe or costly. As an alternative, offline RL (Levine et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2024a) leverages offline datasets of transitions, collected by a behavior policy, to train a policy. To avoid overestimation of the expected return for out-of-di...
