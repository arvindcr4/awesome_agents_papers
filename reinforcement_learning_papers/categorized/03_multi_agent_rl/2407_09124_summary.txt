**TITLE:** Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithm using a Cluster-Synchronized Laser Network
**ARXIV_ID:** 2407.09124v1 [cs.LG]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The authors propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm using a cluster-synchronized laser network to address the competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. The algorithm, called Decentralized Coupling Adjustment (DCA), allows two players to select different slots without sharing information about their slot selections and resultant rewards.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposal of a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm using a cluster-synchronized laser network
* Introduction of the DCA method, which allows players to adjust their optical attenuation rates based on observed slot probabilities
* Numerical simulations demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in balancing exploration and exploitation while avoiding selection conflicts
* Analysis of the effects of hyperparameters on the decision-making system's performance
* Discussion of the potential for applying the proposed algorithm to more complex problem settings, such as those with increased players and slots.
