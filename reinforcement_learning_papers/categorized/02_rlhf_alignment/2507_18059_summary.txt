**PAPER:** Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization
**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization
**ARXIV_ID:** 2507.18059v1 [cs.AI]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization (MAGPO) is a novel framework that bridges the gap between Centralized Training with Centralized Execution (CTCE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). MAGPO leverages a sequentially executed guider for coordinated exploration while constraining it to remain close to the decentralized learner policies.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* MAGPO provides a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning.
* MAGPO outperforms state-of-the-art CTDE methods and is competitive with CTCE methods.
* MAGPO introduces a practical training algorithm with provable monotonic improvement.
* MAGPO enables advances in CTCE methods to directly benefit CTDE methods.
* MAGPO addresses the policy asymmetry problem and observation asymmetry in multi-agent settings.
