**PAPER:** TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Test-Time Reinforcement Learning
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Alignment)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) is a novel method for training large language models using reinforcement learning on unlabeled data. TTRL employs majority voting to estimate rewards and updates the model parameters using these rewards.

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* TTRL achieves consistent improvements across various models and tasks, surpassing the performance of traditional self-training methods.
* TTRL can exceed its training signal and upper limit, closely mirroring the performance of direct training on test data with ground-truth labels.
* TTRL is compatible with different RL algorithms and can be integrated with existing RL methods.
