**PAPER:** [Not specified]
**TITLE:** CURRICULUM-BASED ITERATIVE SELF-PLAY FOR SCALABLE MULTI-DRONE RACING
**ARXIV_ID:** 2510.22570v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (although the paper seems to focus more on multi-agent reinforcement learning and curriculum learning)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework called CRUISE, which integrates a structured curriculum with iterative self-play to learn competitive strategies for multi-drone racing. The curriculum is designed to progressively increase task difficulty and realism, while the self-play mechanism allows agents to learn from each other and adapt to increasingly competent opponents.

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The paper introduces a new framework for learning competitive strategies in multi-agent environments, which combines curriculum learning and self-play.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CRUISE in a simulated multi-drone racing environment, showing that it outperforms standard reinforcement learning baselines and a state-of-the-art game-theoretic planner.
* The paper highlights the importance of curriculum learning in solving the exploration problem in complex multi-agent domains.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the curriculum's contribution to the learning process, using ablation studies to demonstrate its necessity.
* The paper discusses potential future directions, including bridging the sim-to-real gap, automating reward engineering, and exploring more advanced self-play schemes.
