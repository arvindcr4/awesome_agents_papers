**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-enabled Mobile Edge Computing Network
**ARXIV_ID:** 2201.09057v3 [cs.NI]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a distributed solution approach based on cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for joint communication and computing resource allocation (JCCRA) in a cell-free massive MIMO-enabled mobile edge computing network. Each user is implemented as a learning agent that makes joint resource allocation decisions relying on local observations only.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Formulates a user-centric JCCRA problem to minimize the total energy consumption of users while satisfying delay constraints
* Proposes a distributed solution approach based on cooperative MARL
* Evaluates the performance of the proposed approach through simulations and compares it with benchmark schemes
