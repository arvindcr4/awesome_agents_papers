Abstract

Constructing agents with planning capabilities has long been one of the main challenges in the
pursuit of artificial intelligence. Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world
problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work
we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model,
achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without
any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively,
predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and
the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled
- our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without
any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero
algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.

Introduction

Planning algorithms based on lookahead search have achieved remarkable successes in artificial intelligence. Human world champions have been defeated in classic games such as checkers [34], chess [5], Go [38] and poker
[3, 26], and planning algorithms have had real-world impact in applications from logistics [47] to chemical synthesis [37]. However, these planning algorithms all rely on knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, such as the
rules of the game or an accurate simulator, preventing their direct application to real-world domains like robotics,
industrial control, or intelligent assistants.
Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) [42] aims to address this issue by first learning a model of the
environment’s dynamics, and then planning with respect to the learned model. Typically, these models have either
focused on reconstructing the true environmental state [8, 16, 24], or the sequence of full observations [14, 20].
However, prior work [4, 14, 20] remains far from the state of the art in visually rich domains, such as Atari 2600
games [2]. Instead, the most successful methods are based on model-free RL [9, 21, 18] – i.e. they estimate
the optimal policy and/or value function directly from interactions with the environment. However, model-free
algorithms are in turn far from the state of the art in domains that require precise and sophisticated lookahead, such
as chess and Go.

In this paper, we introduce MuZero, a new approach to model-based RL that achieves state-of-the-art performance in Atari 2600, a visually complex set of domains, while maintaining superhuman performance in precision planning tasks such as chess, shogi and Go. MuZero builds upon AlphaZero’s [39] powerful search and
search-based policy iteration algorithms, but incorporates a learned model into the training procedure. MuZero
also extends AlphaZero to a broader set of environments including single agent domains and non-zero rewards at
intermediate time-steps.
The main idea of the algorithm (summarized in Figure 1) is to predict those aspects of the future that are directly
relevant for planning. The model receives the observation (e.g. an image of the Go board or the Atari screen) as an
input and transforms it into a hidden state. The hidden state is then updated iteratively by a recurrent process that
receives the previous hidden state and a hypothetical next action. At every one of these steps the model predicts the
policy (e.g. the move to play), value function (e.g. the predicted winner), and immediate reward (e.g. the points
scored by playing a move). The model is trained end-to-end, with the sole objective of accurately estimating these
three important quantities, so as to match the improved estimates of policy and value generated by search as well
as the observed reward. There is no direct constraint or requirement for the hidden state to capture all information
necessary to reconstruct the original observation, drastically reducing the amount of information the model has
to maintain and predict; nor is there any requirement for the hidden state to match the unknown, true state of the
environment; nor any other constraints on the semantics of state. Instead, the hidden states are free to represent
state in whatever way is relevant to predicting current and future values and policies. Intuitively, the agent can
invent, internally, the rules or dynamics that lead to most accurate planning.

Prior Work

Reinforcement learning may be subdivided into two principal categories: model-based, and model-free [42].
Model-based RL constructs, as an intermediate step, a model of the environment. Classically, this model is
represented by a Markov-decision process (MDP) [31] consisting of two components: a state transition model,
predicting the next state, and a reward model, predicting the expected reward during that transition. The model
is typically conditioned on the selected action, or a temporally abstract behavior such as an option [43]. Once
a model has been constructed, it is straightforward to apply MDP planning algorithms, such as value iteration
[31] or Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) [7], to compute the optimal value or optimal policy for the MDP. In
large or partially observed environments, the algorithm must first construct the state representation that the model
should predict. This tripartite separation between representation learning, model learning, and planning is potentially problematic since the agent is not able to optimize its representation or model for the purpose of effective
planning, so that, for example modeling errors may compound during planning.
A common approach to model-based RL focuses on directly modeling the observation stream at the pixellevel. It has been hypothesized that deep, stochastic models may mitigate the problems of compounding error
[14, 20]. However, planning at pixel-level granularity is not computationally tractable in large scale problems.
Other methods build a latent state-space model that is sufficient to reconstruct the observation stream at pixel level
[48, 49], or to predict its future latent states [13, 11], which facilitates more efficient planning but still focuses
the majority of the model capacity on potentially irrelevant detail. None of these prior methods has constructed a
model that facilitates effective planning in visually complex domains such as Atari; results lag behind well-tuned,
model-free methods, even in terms of data efficiency [45].
A quite different approach to model-based RL has recently been developed, focused end-to-end on predicting
the value function [41]. The main idea of these methods is to construct an abstract MDP model such that planning
in the abstract MDP is equivalent to planning in the real environment. This equivalence is achieved by ensuring
value equivalence, i.e. that, starting from the same real state, the cumulative reward of a trajectory through the
abstract MDP matches the cumulative reward of a trajectory in the real environment.
The predictron [41] first introduced value equivalent models for predicting value (without actions). Although
the underlying model still takes the form of an MDP, there is no requirement for its transition model to match
real states in the environment. Instead the MDP model is viewed as a hidden layer of a deep neural network. The
unrolled MDP is trained such that the expected cumulative sum of rewards matches the expected value with respect
to the real environment, e.g. by temporal-difference learning.

Figure 1: Planning, acting, and training with a learned model. (A) How MuZero uses its model to plan.
The model consists of three connected components for representation, dynamics and prediction. Given a previous
hidden state sk−1 and a candidate action ak , the dynamics function g produces an immediate reward rk and a new
hidden state sk . The policy pk and value function v k are computed from the hidden state sk by a prediction function
f . The initial hidden state s0 is obtained by passing the past observations (e.g. the Go board or Atari screen) into
a representation function h. (B) How MuZero acts in the environment. A Monte-Carlo Tree Search is performed
at each timestep t, as described in A. An action at+1 is sampled from the search policy πt , which is proportional
to the visit count for each action from the root node. The environment receives the action and generates a new
observation ot+1 and reward ut+1 . At the end of the episode the trajectory data is stored into a replay buffer. (C)
How MuZero trains its model. A trajectory is sampled from the replay buffer. For the initial step, the representation
function h receives as input the past observations o1 , ..., ot from the selected trajectory. The model is subsequently
unrolled recurrently for K steps. At each step k, the dynamics function g receives as input the hidden state sk−1
from the previous step and the real action at+k . The parameters of the representation, dynamics and prediction
functions are jointly trained, end-to-end by backpropagation-through-time, to predict three quantities: the policy
pk ≈ πt+k , value function v k ≈ zt+k , and reward rt+k ≈ ut+k , where zt+k is a sample return: either the final
reward (board games) or n-step return (Atari).
Value equivalent models were subsequently extended to optimising value (with actions). TreeQN [10] learns
an abstract MDP model, such that a tree search over that model (represented by a tree-structured neural network)
approximates the optimal value function. Value iteration networks [44] learn a local MDP model, such that value
iteration over that model (represented by a convolutional neural network) approximates the optimal value function.
Value prediction networks [28] are perhaps the closest precursor to MuZero: they learn an MDP model grounded
in real actions; the unrolled MDP is trained such that the cumulative sum of rewards, conditioned on the actual
sequence of actions generated by a simple lookahead search, matches the real environment. Unlike MuZero there
is no policy prediction, and the search only utilizes value prediction.

3 MuZero Algorithm
We now describe the MuZero algorithm in more detail. Predictions are made at each time-step t, for each of
k = 1...K steps, by a model µθ , with parameters θ, conditioned on past observations o1 , ..., ot and future actions
at+1 , ..., at+k . The model predicts three future quantities: the policy pkt ≈ π(at+k+1 |o1 , ..., ot , at+1 , ..., at+k ), the
value function vtk ≈ E [ut+k+1 + γut+k+2 + ...|o1 , ..., ot , at+1 , ..., at+k ], and the immediate reward rtk ≈ ut+k ,

3

where u. is the true, observed reward, π is the policy used to select real actions, and γ is the discount function of
the environment.
Internally, at each time-step t (subscripts t suppressed for simplicity), the model is represented by the combination of a representation function, a dynamics function, and a prediction function. The dynamics function,
rk , sk = gθ (sk−1 , ak ), is a recurrent process that computes, at each hypothetical step k, an immediate reward rk
and an internal state sk . It mirrors the structure of an MDP model that computes the expected reward and state
transition for a given state and action [31]. However, unlike traditional approaches to model-based RL [42], this
internal state sk has no semantics of environment state attached to it – it is simply the hidden state of the overall
model, and its sole purpose is to accurately predict relevant, future quantities: policies, values, and rewards. In
this paper, the dynamics function is represented deterministically; the extension to stochastic transitions is left for
future work. The policy and value functions are computed from the internal state sk by the prediction function,
pk , v k = fθ (sk ), akin to the joint policy and value network of AlphaZero. The “root” state s0 is initialized using
a representation function that encodes past observations, s0 = hθ (o1 , ..., ot ); again this has no special semantics
beyond its support for future predictions.
Given such a model, it is possible to search over hypothetical future trajectories a1 , ..., ak given past observations o1 , ..., ot . For example, a naive search could simply select the k step action sequence that maximizes the
value function. More generally, we may apply any MDP planning algorithm to the internal rewards and state space
induced by the dynamics function. Specifically, we use an MCTS algorithm similar to AlphaZero’s search, generalized to allow for single agent domains and intermediate rewards (see Methods). At each internal node, it makes
use of the policy, value and reward estimates produced by the current model parameters θ. The MCTS algorithm
outputs a recommended policy πt and estimated value νt . An action at+1 ∼ πt is then selected.
All parameters of the model are trained jointly to accurately match the policy, value, and reward, for every
hypothetical step k, to corresponding target values observed after k actual time-steps have elapsed. Similarly to
AlphaZero, the improved policy targets are generated by an MCTS search; the first objective is to minimise the
error between predicted policy pkt and search policy πt+k . Also like AlphaZero, the improved value targets are
generated by playing the game or MDP. However, unlike AlphaZero, we allow for long episodes with discounting
and intermediate rewards by bootstrapping n steps into the future from the search value, zt = ut+1 + γut+2 + ... +
γ n−1 ut+n + γ n νt+n . Final outcomes {lose, draw, win} in board games are treated as rewards ut ∈ {−1, 0, +1}
occuring at the final step of the episode. Specifically, the second objective is to minimize the error between
the predicted value vtk and the value target, zt+k 1 . The reward targets are simply the observed rewards; the third
objective is therefore to minimize the error between the predicted reward rtk and the observed reward ut+k . Finally,
an L2 regularization term is also added, leading to the overall loss:

lt (θ) =

lr (ut+k , rtk ) + lv (zt+k , vtk ) + lp (πt+k , pkt ) + c||θ||2

where lr , lv , and lp are loss functions for reward, value and policy respectively. Supplementary Figure S2 summarizes the equations governing how the MuZero algorithm plans, acts, and learns.

Results

We applied the MuZero algorithm to the classic board games Go, chess and shogi 2 , as benchmarks for challenging
planning problems, and to all 57 games in the Atari Learning Environment [2], as benchmarks for visually complex
RL domains.
In each case we trained MuZero for K = 5 hypothetical steps. Training proceeded for 1 million mini-batches
of size 2048 in board games and of size 1024 in Atari. During both training and evaluation, MuZero used 800
simulations for each search in board games, and 50 simulations for each search in Atari. The representation
1 For chess, Go and shogi, the same squared error loss as AlphaZero is used for rewards and values. A cross-entropy loss was found to be
more stable than a squared error when encountering rewards and values of variable scale in Atari. Cross-entropy was used for the policy loss
in both cases.
2 Imperfect information games such as Poker are not directly addressed by our method.

Figure 2: Evaluation of MuZero throughout training in chess, shogi, Go and Atari. The x-axis shows millions
of training steps. For chess, shogi and Go, the y-axis shows Elo rating, established by playing games against AlphaZero using 800 simulations per move for both players. MuZero’s Elo is indicated by the blue line, AlphaZero’s
Elo by the horizontal orange line. For Atari, mean (full line) and median (dashed line) human normalized scores
across all 57 games are shown on the y-axis. The scores for R2D2 [21], (the previous state of the art in this domain,
based on model-free RL) are indicated by the horizontal orange lines. Performance in Atari was evaluated using
50 simulations every fourth time-step, and then repeating the chosen action four times, as in prior work [25].
function uses the same convolutional [23] and residual [15] architecture as AlphaZero, but with 16 residual blocks
instead of 20. The dynamics function uses the same architecture as the representation function and the prediction
function uses the same architecture as AlphaZero. All networks use 256 hidden planes (see Methods for further
details).
Figure 2 shows the performance throughout training in each game. In Go, MuZero slightly exceeded the performance of AlphaZero, despite using less computation per node in the search tree (16 residual blocks per evaluation
in MuZero compared to 20 blocks in AlphaZero). This suggests that MuZero may be caching its computation in
the search tree and using each additional application of the dynamics model to gain a deeper understanding of the
position.
In Atari, MuZero achieved a new state of the art for both mean and median normalized score across the 57
games of the Arcade Learning Environment, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method R2D2 [21] (a
model-free approach) in 42 out of 57 games, and outperforming the previous best model-based approach SimPLe
[20] in all games (see Table S1).
We also evaluated a second version of MuZero that was optimised for greater sample efficiency. Specifically,
it reanalyzes old trajectories by re-running the MCTS using the latest network parameters to provide fresh targets
(see Appendix H). When applied to 57 Atari games, using 200 million frames of experience per game, MuZero
Reanalyze achieved 731% median normalized score, compared to 192%, 231% and 431% for previous state-ofthe-art model-free approaches IMPALA [9], Rainbow [17] and LASER [36] respectively.
To understand the role of the model in MuZero we also ran several experiments, focusing on the board game
of Go and the Atari game of Ms. Pacman.
First, we tested the scalability of planning (Figure 3A), in the canonical planning problem of Go. We compared
the performance of search in AlphaZero, using a perfect model, to the performance of search in MuZero, using a

learned model. Specifically, the fully trained AlphaZero or MuZero was evaluated by comparing MCTS with
different thinking times. MuZero matched the performance of a perfect model, even when doing much larger
searches (up to 10s thinking time) than those from which the model was trained (around 0.1s thinking time, see
also Figure S3A).
We also investigated the scalability of planning across all Atari games (see Figure 3B). We compared MCTS
with different numbers of simulations, using the fully trained MuZero. The improvements due to planning are
much less marked than in Go, perhaps because of greater model inaccuracy; performance improved slightly with
search time, but plateaued at around 100 simulations. Even with a single simulation – i.e. when selecting moves
solely according to the policy network – MuZero performed well, suggesting that, by the end of training, the raw
policy has learned to internalise the benefits of search (see also Figure S3B).
Next, we tested our model-based learning algorithm against a comparable model-free learning algorithm (see
Figure 3C). We replaced the training objective of MuZero (Equation 1) with a model-free Q-learning objective
(as used by R2D2), and the dual value and policy heads with a single head representing the Q-function Q(·|st ).
Subsequently, we trained and evaluated the new model without using any search. When evaluated on Ms. Pacman,
our model-free algorithm achieved identical results to R2D2, but learned significantly slower than MuZero and
converged to a much lower final score. We conjecture that the search-based policy improvement step of MuZero
provides a stronger learning signal than the high bias, high variance targets used by Q-learning.
To better understand the nature of MuZero’s learning algorithm, we measured how MuZero’s training scales
with respect to the amount of search it uses during training. Figure 3D shows the performance in Ms. Pacman,
using an MCTS of different simulation counts per move throughout training. Surprisingly, and in contrast to
previous work [1], even with only 6 simulations per move – fewer than the number of actions – MuZero learned
an effective policy and improved rapidly. With more simulations performance jumped significantly higher. For
analysis of the policy improvement during each individual iteration, see also Figure S3 C and D.

Conclusions

Many of the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have been based on either high-performance planning [5, 38,
39] or model-free reinforcement learning methods [25, 29, 46]. In this paper we have introduced a method that
combines the benefits of both approaches. Our algorithm, MuZero, has both matched the superhuman performance
of high-performance planning algorithms in their favored domains – logically complex board games such as chess
and Go – and outperformed state-of-the-art model-free RL algorithms in their favored domains – visually complex
Atari games. Crucially, our method does not require any knowledge of the game rules or environment dynamics,
potentially paving the way towards the application of powerful learning and planning methods to a host of realworld domains for which there exists no perfect simulator.

with search time per move in Go, comparing the learned model with the ground truth simulator. Both networks
were trained at 800 simulations per search, equivalent to 0.1 seconds per search. Remarkably, the learned model
is able to scale well to up to two orders of magnitude longer searches than seen during training. (B) Scaling of
final human normalized mean score in Atari with the number of simulations per search. The network was trained
at 50 simulations per search. Dark line indicates mean score, shaded regions indicate 25th to 75th and 5th to
95th percentiles. The learned model’s performance increases up to 100 simulations per search. Beyond, even
when scaling to much longer searches than during training, the learned model’s performance remains stable and
only decreases slightly. This contrasts with the much better scaling in Go (A), presumably due to greater model
inaccuracy in Atari than Go. (C) Comparison of MCTS based training with Q-learning in the MuZero framework
on Ms. Pacman, keeping network size and amount of training constant. The state of the art Q-Learning algorithm
R2D2 is shown as a baseline. Our Q-Learning implementation reaches the same final score as R2D2, but improves
slower and results in much lower final performance compared to MCTS based training. (D) Different networks
trained at different numbers of simulations per move, but all evaluated at 50 simulations per move. Networks
trained with more simulations per move improve faster, consistent with ablation (B), where the policy improvement
is larger when using more simulations per move. Surprisingly, MuZero can learn effectively even when training
with less simulations per move than are enough to cover all 8 possible actions in Ms. Pacman.

Appendix A

Comparison to AlphaZero

MuZero is designed for a more general setting than AlphaGo Zero [40] and AlphaZero [39].
In AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero the planning process makes use of two separate components: a simulator
implements the rules of the game, which are used to update the state of the game while traversing the search
tree; and a neural network jointly predicts the corresponding policy and value of a board position produced by the
simulator (see Figure 1 A).
Specifically, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero use knowledge of the rules of the game in three places: (1) state
transitions in the search tree, (2) actions available at each node of the search tree, (3) episode termination within
the search tree. In MuZero, all of these have been replaced with the use of a single implicit model learned by a
neural network (see Figure 1 B):
1) State transitions. AlphaZero had access to a perfect simulator of the true dynamics process. In contrast,
MuZero employs a learned dynamics model within its search. Under this model, each node in the tree is
represented by a corresponding hidden state; by providing a hidden state sk−1 and an action ak to the model
the search algorithm can transition to a new node sk = g(sk−1 , ak ).
2) Actions available. AlphaZero used the set of legal actions obtained from the simulator to mask the prior
produced by the network everywhere in the search tree. MuZero only masks legal actions at the root of the
search tree where the environment can be queried, but does not perform any masking within the search tree.
This is possible because the network rapidly learns not to predict actions that never occur in the trajectories
it is trained on.
3) Terminal nodes. AlphaZero stopped the search at tree nodes representing terminal states and used the terminal value provided by the simulator instead of the value produced by the network. MuZero does not give
special treatment to terminal nodes and always uses the value predicted by the network. Inside the tree, the
search can proceed past a terminal node - in this case the network is expected to always predict the same
value. This is achieved by treating terminal states as absorbing states during training.
In addition, MuZero is designed to operate in the general reinforcement learning setting: single-agent domains
with discounted intermediate rewards of arbitrary magnitude. In contrast, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero were
designed to operate in two-player games with undiscounted terminal rewards of ±1.

Appendix B

Search

We now describe the search algorithm used by MuZero. Our approach is based upon Monte-Carlo tree search with
upper confidence bounds, an approach to planning that converges asymptotically to the optimal policy in single
agent domains and to the minimax value function in zero sum games [22].
Every node of the search tree is associated with an internal state s. For each action a from s there is an
edge (s, a) that stores a set of statistics {N (s, a), Q(s, a), P (s, a), R(s, a), S(s, a)}, respectively representing
visit counts N , mean value Q, policy P , reward R, and state transition S.
Similar to AlphaZero, the search is divided into three stages, repeated for a number of simulations.
Selection: Each simulation starts from the internal root state s0 , and finishes when the simulation reaches a
leaf node sl . For each hypothetical time-step k = 1...l of the simulation, an action ak is selected according to the
stored statistics for internal state sk−1 , by maximizing over an upper confidence bound [32][39],

The constants c1 and c2 are used to control the influence of the prior P (s, a) relative to the value Q(s, a) as
nodes are visited more often. In our experiments, c1 = 1.25 and c2 = 19652.
For k < l, the next state and reward are looked up in the state transition and reward table sk = S(sk−1 , ak ),
k
r = R(sk−1 , ak ).
Expansion: At the final time-step l of the simulation, the reward and state are computed by the dynamics
function, rl , sl = gθ (sl−1 , al ), and stored in the corresponding tables, R(sl−1 , al ) = rl , S(sl−1 , al ) = sl . The
policy and value are computed by the prediction function, pl , v l = fθ (sl ). A new node, corresponding to state
sl is added to the search tree. Each edge (sl , a) from the newly expanded node is initialized to {N (sl , a) =
0, Q(sl , a) = 0, P (sl , a) = pl }. Note that the search algorithm makes at most one call to the dynamics function
and prediction function respectively per simulation; the computational cost is of the same order as in AlphaZero.
Backup: At the end of the simulation, the statistics along the trajectory are updated. The backup is generalized
to the case where the environment can emit intermediate rewards, have a discount γ different from 1, and the value
estimates are unbounded 3 . For k = l...0, we form an l − k-step estimate of the cumulative discounted reward,
bootstrapping from the value function v l ,
k

G =

l−1−k
X

(3)

τ =0

For k = l...1, we update the statistics for each edge (sk−1 , ak ) in the simulation path as follows,
Q(sk−1 , ak ) :=

N (sk−1 , ak ) · Q(sk−1 , ak ) + Gk
N (sk−1 , ak ) + 1

(4)

N (sk−1 , ak ) := N (sk−1 , ak ) + 1
In two-player zero sum games the value functions are assumed to be bounded within the [0, 1] interval. This
choice allows us to combine value estimates with probabilities using the pUCT rule (Eqn 2). However, since in
many environments the value is unbounded, it is necessary to adjust the pUCT rule. A simple solution would be
to use the maximum score that can be observed in the environment to either re-scale the value or set the pUCT
constants appropriately [33]. However, both solutions are game specific and require adding prior knowledge to
the MuZero algorithm. To avoid this, MuZero computes normalized Q value estimates Q ∈ [0, 1] by using the
minimum-maximum values observed in the search tree up to that point. When a node is reached during the
selection stage, the algorithm computes the normalized Q values of its edges to be used in the pUCT rule using the
equation below:
Q(sk−1 , ak ) =

Q(sk−1 , ak ) − mins,a∈T ree Q(s, a)
maxs,a∈T ree Q(s, a) − mins,a∈T ree Q(s, a)

3 In board games the discount is assumed to be 1 and there are no intermediate rewards.

Appendix C

Hyperparameters

For simplicity we preferentially use the same architectural choices and hyperparameters as in previous work.
Specifically, we started with the network architecture and search choices of AlphaZero [39]. For board games, we
use the same UCB constants, dirichlet exploration noise and the same 800 simulations per search as in AlphaZero.
Due to the much smaller branching factor and simpler policies in Atari, we only used 50 simulations per search
to speed up experiments. As shown in Figure 3B, the algorithm is not very sensitive to this choice. We also use the
same discount (0.997) and value transformation (see Network Architecture section) as R2D2 [21].
For parameter values not mentioned in the text, please refer to the pseudocode.

Appendix D

Data Generation

To generate training data, the latest checkpoint of the network (updated every 1000 training steps) is used to play
games with MCTS. In the board games Go, chess and shogi the search is run for 800 simulations per move to pick
an action; in Atari due to the much smaller action space 50 simulations per move are sufficient.
For board games, games are sent to the training job as soon as they finish. Due to the much larger length of
Atari games (up to 30 minutes or 108,000 frames), intermediate sequences are sent every 200 moves. In board
games, the training job keeps an in-memory replay buffer of the most recent 1 million games received; in Atari,
where the visual observations are larger, the most recent 125 thousand sequences of length 200 are kept.
During the generation of experience in the board game domains, the same exploration scheme as the one
described in AlphaZero [39] is used. Using a variation of this scheme, in the Atari domain actions are sampled
from the visit count distribution throughout the duration of each game, instead of just the first k moves. Moreover,
the visit count distribution is parametrized using a temperature parameter T :
N (α)1/T
pα = P
1/T
b N (b)

(6)

T is decayed as a function of the number of training steps of the network. Specifically, for the first 500k
training steps a temperature of 1 is used, for the next 250k steps a temperature of 0.5 and for the remaining 250k a
temperature of 0.25. This ensures that the action selection becomes greedier as training progresses.

Appendix E

Network Input

Representation Function
The history over board states used as input to the representation function for Go, chess and shogi is represented
similarly to AlphaZero [39]. In Go and shogi we encode the last 8 board states as in AlphaZero; in chess we
increased the history to the last 100 board states to allow correct prediction of draws.
For Atari, the input of the representation function includes the last 32 RGB frames at resolution 96x96 along
with the last 32 actions that led to each of those frames. We encode the historical actions because unlike board
games, an action in Atari does not necessarily have a visible effect on the observation. RGB frames are encoded
as one plane per color, rescaled to the range [0, 1], for red, green and blue respectively. We perform no other
normalization, whitening or other preprocessing of the RGB input. Historical actions are encoded as simple bias
planes, scaled as a/18 (there are 18 total actions in Atari).

Dynamics Function
The input to the dynamics function is the hidden state produced by the representation function or previous application of the dynamics function, concatenated with a representation of the action for the transition. Actions are
encoded spatially in planes of the same resolution as the hidden state. In Atari, this resolution is 6x6 (see description of downsampling in Network Architecture section), in board games this is the same as the board size (19x19
for Go, 8x8 for chess, 9x9 for shogi).
13

In Go, a normal action (playing a stone on the board) is encoded as an all zero plane, with a single one in the
position of the played stone. A pass is encoded as an all zero plane.
In chess, 8 planes are used to encode the action. The first one-hot plane encodes which position the piece was
moved from. The next two planes encode which position the piece was moved to: a one-hot plane to encode the
target position, if on the board, and a second binary plane to indicate whether the target was valid (on the board) or
not. This is necessary because for simplicity our policy action space enumerates a superset of all possible actions,
not all of which are legal, and we use the same action space for policy prediction and to encode the dynamics
function input. The remaining five binary planes are used to indicate the type of promotion, if any (queen, knight,
bishop, rook, none).
The encoding for shogi is similar, with a total of 11 planes. We use the first 8 planes to indicate where the
piece moved from - either a board position (first one-hot plane) or the drop of one of the seven types of prisoner
(remaining 7 binary planes). The next two planes are used to encode the target as in chess. The remaining binary
plane indicates whether the move was a promotion or not.
In Atari, an action is encoded as a one hot vector which is tiled appropriately into planes.

Appendix F

Network Architecture

The prediction function pk , v k = fθ (sk ) uses the same architecture as AlphaZero: one or two convolutional layers
that preserve the resolution but reduce the number of planes, followed by a fully connected layer to the size of the
output.
For value
p and reward prediction in Atari we follow [30] in scaling targets using an invertible transform h(x) =
sign(x)( |x| + 1 − 1 + x), where  = 0.001 in all our experiments. We then apply a transformation φ to the
scalar reward and value targets in order to obtain equivalent categorical representations. We use a discrete support
set of size 601 with one support for every integer between −300 and 300. Under this transformation, each scalar
is represented as the linear combination of its two adjacent supports, such that the original value can be recovered
by x = xlow ∗ plow + xhigh ∗ phigh . As an example, a target of 3.7 would be represented as a weight of 0.3
on the support for 3 and a weight of 0.7 on the support for 4. The value and reward outputs of the network are
also modeled using a softmax output of size 601. During inference the actual value and rewards are obtained by
first computing their expected value under their respective softmax distribution and subsequently by inverting the
scaling transformation. Scaling and transformation of the value and reward happens transparently on the network
side and is not visible to the rest of the algorithm.
Both the representation and dynamics function use the same architecture as AlphaZero, but with 16 instead of
20 residual blocks [15]. We use 3x3 kernels and 256 hidden planes for each convolution.
For Atari, where observations have large spatial resolution, the representation function starts with a sequence
of convolutions with stride 2 to reduce the spatial resolution. Specifically, starting with an input observation of
resolution 96x96 and 128 planes (32 history frames of 3 color channels each, concatenated with the corresponding
32 actions broadcast to planes), we downsample as follows:
• 1 convolution with stride 2 and 128 output planes, output resolution 48x48.
• 2 residual blocks with 128 planes
• 1 convolution with stride 2 and 256 output planes, output resolution 24x24.
• 3 residual blocks with 256 planes.
• Average pooling with stride 2, output resolution 12x12.
• 3 residual blocks with 256 planes.
• Average pooling with stride 2, output resolution 6x6.
The kernel size is 3x3 for all operations.
For the dynamics function (which always operates at the downsampled resolution of 6x6), the action is first
encoded as an image, then stacked with the hidden state of the previous step along the plane dimension.
14

Appendix G

Training

During training, the MuZero network is unrolled for K hypothetical steps and aligned to sequences sampled from
the trajectories generated by the MCTS actors. Sequences are selected by sampling a state from any game in the
replay buffer, then unrolling for K steps from that state. In Atari, samples are drawn according to prioritized replay
pα
[35], with priority P (i) = P ipα , where pi = |νi − zi |, ν is the search value and z the observed n-step return. To
k k
correct for sampling bias introduced by the prioritized sampling, we scale the loss using the importance sampling
ratio wi = ( N1 · P 1(i) )β . In all our experiments, we set α = β = 1. For board games, states are sampled uniformly.
Each observation ot along the sequence also has a corresponding MCTS policy πt , estimated value νt and
environment reward ut . At each unrolled step k the network has a loss to the value, policy and reward target for
that step, summed to produce the total loss for the MuZero network (see Equation 1). Note that, in board games
without intermediate rewards, we omit the reward prediction loss. For board games, we bootstrap directly to the
end of the game, equivalent to predicting the final outcome; for Atari we bootstrap for n = 10 steps into the future.
To maintain roughly similar magnitude of gradient across different unroll steps, we scale the gradient in two
separate locations:
1
, where K is the number of unroll steps. This ensures that the total
• We scale the loss of each head by K
gradient has similar magnitude irrespective of how many steps we unroll for.

• We also scale the gradient at the start of the dynamics function by 21 . This ensures that the total gradient
applied to the dynamics function stays constant.
In the experiments reported in this paper, we always unroll for K = 5 steps. For a detailed illustration, see
Figure 1.
To improve the learning process and bound the activations, we also scale the hidden state to the same range as
s−min(s)
the action input ([0, 1]): sscaled = max(s)−min(s)
.
All experiments were run using third generation Google Cloud TPUs [12]. For each board game, we used 16
TPUs for training and 1000 TPUs for selfplay. For each game in Atari, we used 8 TPUs for training and 32 TPUs for
selfplay. The much smaller proportion of TPUs used for acting in Atari is due to the smaller number of simulations
per move (50 instead of 800) and the smaller size of the dynamics function compared to the representation function.

Appendix H

Reanalyze

To improve the sample efficiency of MuZero we introduced a second variant of the algorithm, MuZero Reanalyze. MuZero Reanalyze revisits its past time-steps and re-executes its search using the latest model parameters,
potentially resulting in a better quality policy than the original search. This fresh policy is used as the policy
target for 80% of updates during MuZero training. Furthermore, a target network [25] ·, v − = fθ− (s0 ), based
on recent parameters θ− , is used to provide a fresher, stable n-step bootstrapped target for the value function,
−
zt = ut+1 + γut+2 + ... + γ n−1 ut+n + γ n vt+n
. In addition, several other hyperparameters were adjusted – primarily to increase sample reuse and avoid overfitting of the value function. Specifically, 2.0 samples were drawn
per state, instead of 0.1; the value target was weighted down to 0.25 compared to weights of 1.0 for policy and
reward targets; and the n-step return was reduced to n = 5 steps instead of n = 10 steps.

Appendix I

Evaluation

We evaluated the relative strength of MuZero (Figure 2) in board games by measuring the Elo rating of each
player. We estimate the probability that player a will defeat player b by a logistic function p(a defeats b) =
(1+ 10(celo (e(b)−e(a))) )−1 , and estimate the ratings e(·) by Bayesian logistic regression, computed by the BayesElo
program [6] using the standard constant celo = 1/400.
Elo ratings were computed from the results of a 800 simulations per move tournament between iterations of
MuZero during training, and also a baseline player: either Stockfish, Elmo or AlphaZero respectively. Baseline

players used an equivalent search time of 100ms per move. The Elo rating of the baseline players was anchored to
publicly available values [39].
In Atari, we computed mean reward over 1000 episodes per game, limited to the standard 30 minutes or 108,000
frames per episode [27], using 50 simulations per move unless indicated otherwise. In order to mitigate the effects
of the deterministic nature of the Atari simulator we employed two different evaluation strategies: 30 noop random
starts and human starts. For the former, at the beginning of each episode a random number of between 0 and 30
noop actions are applied to the simulator before handing control to the agent. For the latter, start positions are
sampled from human expert play to initialize the Atari simulator before handing the control to the agent [27].

Figure S3: Details of MuZero evaluations (A-B) and policy improvement ablations (C-D). (A-B) Distribution
of evaluation depth in the search tree for the learned model for the evaluations in Figure 3A-B. The network was
trained over 5 hypothetical steps, as indicated by the red line. Dark blue line indicates median depth from the
root, dark shaded region shows 25th to 75th percentile, light shaded region shows 5th to 95th percentile. (C)
Policy improvement in Ms. Pacman - a single network was trained at 50 simulations per search and is evaluated at
different numbers of simulations per search, including playing according to the argmax of the raw policy network.
The policy improvement effect of the search over the raw policy network is clearly visible throughout training. This
consistent gap between the performance with and without search highlights the policy improvement that MuZero
exploits, by continually updating towards the improved policy, to efficiently progress towards the optimal policy.
(D) Policy improvement in Go - a single network was trained at 800 simulations per search and is evaluated at
different numbers of simulations per search. In Go, the playing strength improvement from longer searches is
much larger than in Ms. Pacman and persists throughout training, consistent with previous results in [40]. This
suggests, as might intuitively be expected, that the benefit of models is greatest in precision planning domains.
