The Option Keyboard Combining Skills in Reinforcement Learning  arXiv:2106.13105v1 [cs.AI] 24 Jun 2021  André Barreto, Diana Borsa, Shaobo Hou, Gheorghe Comanici, Eser Aygün, Philippe Hamel, Daniel Toyama, Jonathan Hunt, Shibl Mourad, David Silver, Doina Precup {andrebarreto,borsa,shaobohou,gcomanici,eser}@google.com {hamelphi,kenjitoyama,jjhunt,shibl,davidsilver,doinap}@google.com  DeepMind  Abstract The ability to combine known skills to create new ones may be crucial in the solution of complex reinforcement learning problems that unfold over extended periods. We argue that a robust way of c...
