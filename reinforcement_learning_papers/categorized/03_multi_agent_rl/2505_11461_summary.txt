TITLE: Signal attenuation enables scalable decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning over networks
ARXIV_ID: 2505.11461v2
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach for power allocation in radar networks. The authors leverage signal attenuation properties inherent in radar networks to enable decentralization and scalability. They derive local neighborhood approximations for global value function and policy gradient estimates and establish corresponding error bounds. The approach is demonstrated through two constrained multi-agent Markov decision process formulations of the power allocation problem.
