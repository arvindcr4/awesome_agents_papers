Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Lee Princeton University jasonlee@princeton.edu  Wen Sun Cornell University ws455@cornell.edu  Abstract While originally developed for continuous control problems, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as the work-horse of a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) applications, including the fine-tuning of generative models."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 02_rlhf_alignment because it explicitly discusses concepts such as human feedback, preference, alignment, matching the research direction's core themes.
