**TITLE**: AOAD-MAT: Transformer-based Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Model considering Agents’ Order of Action Decisions
**ARXIV_ID**: 2510.13343v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: The proposed AOAD-MAT model is a novel Transformer-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model that explicitly incorporates and learns the optimal order of agent action decisions. It leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. The model introduces a dedicated mechanism to predict and optimize the sequence in which agents should act, and it incorporates a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act into a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based loss function.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* The proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, including the original MAT, for various scenarios.
* The model explicitly learns and optimizes the order of agent action decisions, which improves the overall team performance and learning process efficiency.
* The paper provides insights into the importance of the order of action decisions in multi-agent reinforcement learning and proposes new research directions.
* The model is evaluated on challenging benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Multi-Agent MuJoCo (MA-MuJoCo) environments.
* The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AOAD-MAT model in complex multi-agent environments.
