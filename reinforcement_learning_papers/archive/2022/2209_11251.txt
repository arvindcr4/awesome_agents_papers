ABSTRACT
We present time-series CCD photometry in the BV RI passbands of the recently identiﬁed symbiotic
nova V1835 Aquilae (NSV 11749) over an interval of 5.1 years with 7-14 day cadence, observed
during its quiescence. We ﬁnd slow light variations with a range of ∼0.9 mag in V and ∼0.3 mag
in I. Analysis of these data show strong periodicity at 419 ± 10 days, which we interpret to be
the system’s orbital period. A dip in the otherwise-sinusoidal phased light curve suggests a weak
ellipsoidal eﬀect due to tidal distortion of the giant star, which in turn opens the possibility that

V1835 Aql transfers some of its mass to the hot component via Roche lobe overﬂow rather than
via a stellar wind. We also ﬁnd evidence that V1835 Aql is an S-type symbiotic star, relatively free
of circumstellar dust, and include it among the nuclear burning group of symbiotics. Finally, we
provide photometry, periods, and light curve classiﬁcations for 22 variable stars in the ﬁeld around
V1835 Aql, about half of which are newly identiﬁed.

1. INTRODUCTION

Symbiotic stars (hereafter “SySt”) are a rare subclass of cataclysmic variables consisting of a wide
interacting binary containing a cool giant star and a very hot star surrounded by gas that is excited
by the latter’s short-wavelength radiation. In optical spectra, this produces the unusual combination
of absorption features characteristic of cool star overlain by emission features from the hot gas
(Mikolajewska 2003a; Mikolajewska et al. 2015), an unexpected combination that prompted the term
“symbiotic.” In many cases, the hot star is a degenerate object, a white dwarf or neutron star, while
the cool star is a red giant or supergiant that may be tidally distorted by its proximity to the hot
star. The cool star may emit a stellar wind, some of which interacts with the hot star to generate the
excited circumstellar envelope and which accretes onto its surface. This complex arrangement can
produce several types of brightness variations which may include ellipsoidal behavior, a “reﬂection
eﬀect” due to orbital motion, and irregular variations related to accretion. In some cases, the cool star
pulsates, providing a Mira-like element to the light curve (Mikolajewska 2003a; Angeloni et al. 2014).
Diﬀerent stars exhibit diﬀerent degrees of these behaviors, and are collected in the inhomogeneous
“Z Andromedae” (ZAND) class of objects (Samus & Durlevich 2009). The AAVSO Variable Star
Index (VSX) currently lists 157 stars with this classiﬁcation.1
An even rarer, related group is the NC class of slow novae (Samus & Durlevich 2009). The VSX
lists only six such stars. Outbursts of up to 10 mag are characterized by a slow rise to peak light,
which is sustained for about a decade and followed by a very slow decline. The spectra of some
members can resemble those of SySt, and long-period light variations like those in SySt have been
observed during quiescence. Mikolajewska (2010) provides an excellent description of these symbiotic
novae.
A recent addition to the short list of slow, symbiotic novae is V1835 Aquilae. Earlier identiﬁed as
NSV 11749 (Kazarovets et al. 2015), the star was ﬁrst discovered to be variable by Luyten (1937).
Williams (2005) derived photometry from plates in the Harvard collection showing an outburst circa

1903 that reached a photographic magnitude of 12.5 then slowly faded below the plate limit of
mptg ≈ 15 mag by 1912. It remained below this limit through the end of the plate sequence in
1988, though it had been detected on a few deeper plates at ∼17 mag. Based on this outburst,
Williams suggested that V1835 Aql is either a slow nova or a FU Orionis pre-main sequence star.
Bond & Kasliwal (2012) presented optical and infrared spectra of V1835 Aql showing Balmer and
helium emission lines on a continuous spectrum of a M1-M2 giant. Their spectrum also showed a
broad emission line at 6825 Å caused by light from quintuply-ionized oxygen (O VI) at 1032 Å,
Raman-scattering oﬀ of cold, neutral hydrogen, an eﬀect only seen in SySt. Bond & Kasliwal (2012)
provided an excellent discussion of the preceding interpretations of V1835 Aql and gave convincing
evidence that this intriguing object is a symbiotic star.
V1835 Aql was detected independently by a survey for H-alpha emission (Kohoutek & Wehmeyer
1997) and the ChaMPlane project to detect cataclysmic variables (Grindlay et al. 2005; Rogel et al.
2006). Wehrung et al. (2013) monitored V1835 Aql photometrically in the V I passbands for six
months in 2012 and saw slow variations that supported the assessment of Bond & Kasliwal (2012)
that V1835 Aql is a symbiotic nova. However, the duration of that time-series was too short to
determine the periodic nature of the star. Wehrung et al. (2013) also provided a spectrum of the
star (which did not cover the SySt diagnostic line at 6825 Å) and argued for a reddening value
of E(B − V ) = 0.67 ± 0.10 mag. In addition, they found nine additional variable stars located
nearby, many of which are now listed in the VSX under the name “[WLR2013] #” where the number
corresponds to the identiﬁcation shown in Table 2 of Wehrung et al. (2013).
In this paper, we report continued time-series CCD photometry of V1835 Aql aimed at clarifying
the nature of this object in quiescence and determining its orbital period. We also update the
photometric properties of the nearby variable stars and detect new ones. In Section 2 we describe
the new observations, and outine the stellar photometry in Section 3. We analyze the light curve
of V1835 Aql in Section 4, and discuss the light curves of the other variable stars in Section 5. We
summarize our results in Section 6 and suggest future observations to further clarify the nature of
V1835 Aql.

2. OBSERVATIONS

We obtained images of V1835 Aql between 2012 and 2017 using the Panchromatic Robotic Optical
Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescopes (PROMPT) located on Cerro Tololo in Chile (Reichart et al.
2005). During this time, we used a variety of telescopes and CCD cameras, as summarized in Table 1,
in order to maintain a regular monitoring cadence as the availability of the PROMPT equipment
shifted over time; a secondary goal was to minimize equipment changes in order to maximize the
internal consistency of our data set. Throughout this time, images were acquired using the Johnson
V ﬁlter and the Cousins I ﬁlter.2 Additional images were obtained contemporaneously with the V I
images in the Johnson B ﬁlter between 2013-03-09 and 2014-09-26 (on a total of 51 nights), and
in the Cousins R ﬁlter from 2012-08-05 to 2013-11-05 (40 nights). On most nights, three images
were obtained in each ﬁlter, with the telescope position oﬀset by a few pixels between each exposure.
Observing nights were separated by 7-14 days in order to maintain a slow, regular cadence suited

These include the PROMPT observations taken from July to November 2012 and presented in Wehrung et al.

(2013). We have reanalyzed these images herein to maximize consistency with the PROMPT images taken after 2012,
as described below.

to the long periods of the variable stars found by Wehrung et al. (2013). All images were processed
using the standard methods of bias, dark-current, and ﬂat-ﬁeld correction.
When combined with the early observations made with the 0.5-m telescope at Bowling Green State
University (BGSU; see Table 1) described in Wehrung et al. (2013)3 , we have photometry from a
total of 1190 images taken on 157 independent nights spanning the Julian dates of 2,456,064 to
2,457,933 days (5.1 years). The median seeing of the V -band images was 2.5 arcsec full-width at
half-maximum, and 2.7 arcsec for the I-band images, though in all ﬁlter sets the seeing varied from
1.6 to 3.7 arcsec at the 10% and 90% points of the seeing distribution.

3. STELLAR PHOTOMETRY

We analyzed all the PROMPT images following the methods described in Wehrung et al. (2013).
We obtained a list of star positions and instrumental magnitudes for each image using the
DAOPHOT II point-spread function ﬁtting software (Stetson 1987). These lists were merged using DAOMASTER and the instrumental magnitudes for each image were reﬁned using ALLFRAME
(Stetson 1994) utilizing a star list based on the best quality images. Using a uniform star list helps to
mitigate the eﬀect of blending and merging of stellar proﬁles resulting from the range of seeing conditions present in our images. We separated the images into sets based on the telescope, camera and
ﬁlter used (see Table 1) and processed them separately with DAOMASTER and ALLFRAME. In doing so, we found that during the “P5AU” set, and again during the “P1AU” set, there was an abrupt
rotation in the images (perhaps due to removal of the camera for maintenance) that complicated the
DAOMASTER/ALLFRAME process; we split the images into separate pre- and post-rotation sets
and found that the resulting DAOMASTER/ALLFRAME analysis ran well.
For each telescope-camera-ﬁlter set, we used the instrumental and standard magnitudes (mi and
ms respectively) of ﬁfteen in-ﬁeld secondary standard stars established in Wehrung et al. (2013) to

obtain the coeﬃcients c0 and c1 in the transformation equation
mi − ms = c0 + c1 (V − I)s ,

(1)

where (V − I)s is the standard color. The rms scatter around these least-squares ﬁts were typically
about 0.026 mag in V , about 0.044 mag in I, and 0.019 mag in R. For B, we did not have standard
magnitudes from Wehrung et al. (2013), so we downloaded data for six uncrowded comparison stars
from the APASS database (Henden & Munari 2014; Henden et al. 2015)4 . Though the formal uncertainty in the each APASS B magnitude was relatively large, ∼0.06 mag, the rms scatter around the
B ﬁt was only 0.031 mag, indicating a reliable calibration.
We then applied the coeﬃcients to every star in the set to obtain the average standard magnitude
of each star in each passband. The resulting color-magnitude diagram for the P5AA set is shown
in Figure 1. We estimate the overall zero-point uncertainty in the photometric calibrations to be
approximately 0.02 mag in V and I, and about 0.04 mag in R and B. The lower resolution of the
APASS images and consequent potential for blending of faint neighbor stars with each comparison
star leads to a concern that a systematic error in our B magnitude transformation could be present.
To detect variable stars, we used the Welch & Stetson (1993) method on our paired V and I
magnitudes from the 2.3-year P5AA data set to search for correlated brightness changes. We found
17 variable stars, ten of which had been identiﬁed by Wehrung et al. (2013), including V1835 Aql.
We also applied the Welch & Stetson (1993) analysis on the P1AU data set; though the data span
a much shorter interval of 0.4 years, the much larger ﬁeld of view could contain many variable stars
in addition to the three originally detected by Wehrung et al. (2013) from the BGSU data set (#85,
#132 and #419). We again used the Welch & Stetson (1993) variability index to identify variable
candidates in the P1AU set, but adjusted our selection criteria from those used in the P5AA search
to focus on stars that show slow, correlated variations in V and I in their time-magnitude plots, as
well as red mean colors. No doubt this has biased our search toward ﬁnding long period variable
stars in the P1AU ﬁelds, within which we detected six new variable stars.

mag, the exception being the bright star #1 with Jerr = 0.22 and Kerr = 0.29 mag. The 2MASS
photometry conﬁrms that most of the new variable stars are quite red.
Also shown in Table 2 is the distance to each star in kiloparsecs, computed from the trigonometric
parallax listed in the early third data release “EDR3” (Gaia Collaboration 2021) of the Gaia space
astrometry mission (Gaia Collaboration 2016). Cases in which the parallax error was more than
half the parallax value are of little direct use, and are excluded from the table. The exception is
V1835 Aql, for which we ﬁnd a photometric distance of 8-11 kpc as described at then end of Sec. 4.
For each of these 23 variable stars plus the 15 comparison stars discussed above, we extracted the
instrumental time-series photometry from ALLFRAME, and combined them diﬀerentially to obtain
standard BV RI magnitudes. For a particular variable star on a speciﬁc image, we calculated
ms,v = ms,c + mi,v − mi,c − c1 [(V − I)s,v − (V − I)s,c ],

(2)

where the v and c subscripts refer to the variable and comparison star, respectively. We repeated
this calculation for each of the Nc comparison stars visible on that image to arrive at Nc separate
estimates of the variable star’s magnitude, then took the median of the Nc estimates as the best
estimate. We also computed the standard deviation of the mean (σm ) from the Nc estimates as
the best estimate of the uncertainty in the variable star’s standard magnitude. Another estimate of
this uncertainty, ǫ was produced by propagating the photometric errors from ALLFRAME and the
uncertainty of the comparison stars’ standard magnitudes through Eqn. 2. These values are listed
in Table 3, along with the heliocentric Julian date (HJD) of the observation, the FWHM seeing (in
arcsec), the airmass at the time of observation, and an integer on a 1-5 scale describing the visual
quality of stellar proﬁles on the image (Q = 1 indicates round star with a radial proﬁle plot having
little scatter; Q = 5 marks a very elongated proﬁle due to tracking errors and/or an out of focus
stellar proﬁle, both of which have large scatter in their radial proﬁle plots). The photometry set is
also indicated.
The locations of the 23 variable stars are marked in the color-magnitude diagram of Figure 1. We
note that many of the variable stars are signiﬁcantly more red than the comparison stars (0.6 <

V − I < 2.3 mag), so that uncertainty in establishing the coeﬃcient c1 in the equation above can
lead to a systematic zero-point error in the resulting magnitude of each variable star.
4. THE LIGHT CURVE OF V1835 AQL

The light curve of the symbiotic star V1835 Aql is shown in Figure 2. For images obtained within
a 12-hour span, the resulting photometry was combined using an error-weighted mean to obtain
a single data point per ﬁlter per night, shown connected by the green line. The transition times
between the diﬀerent telescope-camera sets are indicated. The photometry appears to be smooth

12

Caddy et al.

and continuous throughout the time series, indicating that we successfully transformed the diﬀerent
sets of instrumental photometry onto a consistent standard system. Additional tests on several
non-variable check stars conﬁrmed that there were no signiﬁcant jumps at the transitions between
data sets that might indicate problems with the photometric calibrations. The ∼100-day gaps in
the time series resulted because the star was below an elevation of ∼20 degrees all night between
mid-November and late-February each year.
Despite the observational scatter, Figure 2 shows fairly regular cyclic behavior with an amplitude of
∼0.9 mag in V and ∼0.3 mag in I. Several points are worth noting. First, the level of maximum light
appears to be similar from peak to peak in both ﬁlters, though the presence of the data gaps makes
this diﬃcult to ascertain. Second, the level of the minima is similar from cycle to cycle, though the
star is faint in V at minimum light and the resulting scatter is large. Third, the light curve shape is
consistent with that of a contact binary (W Ursae Majoris type variable, EW) or ellipsoidal variable
(ELL) with a period of ∼850 days, or with a pulsating variable with a period half that length.
Analysis of the V -band data using the discrete Fourier transform method implemented in VStar
Benn (2012) yielded a period 423 of days. A similar application using the I-band data resulted in
a period of 431 d, but the lower amplitude in this passband yielded a peak with lower power. We
obtained another estimate of the period by estimating the times of minimum light seen in Figure 2
and ﬁtting them with a linear ephemeris of the form JDmin = P Ncyc + E0 , to obtain P = 419 ± 10 d
and E0 = 2, 456, 834 ± 10 d, which we adopt as the best description of the single peak-trough cycle
seen in Figure 2.
Figure 3 shows the light and V − I color curves of V1835 Aql phased with twice this period, the
expected orbital period if the system is expressing ellipsoidal variation similar to that seen in a
sample of ELL-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by Soszyński et al. (2004). In our
phased light curves, the primary eclipse at φ = 0 is marginally deeper (∼1.5-σ) than the secondary
eclipse. This slight diﬀerence is common among ellipsoidal variables with a main-sequence secondary
star (Soszyński et al. 2004) and has been attributed to limb-darkening and gravity-darkening in the
elongated “tip” of the primary star that points toward the secondary, so that the deeper light curve

minimum occurs when this tip is pointing toward the observer; the diﬀerence tends to be largest
when the primary ﬁlls its Roche lobe (Hall 1990).

shifted vertically by the indicated amounts for convenience of display.

However, the light curve amplitude of V1835 Aql, ∼0.3 mag in I, is large compared with those of
ellipsoidal variables in the LCM having periods longer than 500 days (Soszyński et al. 2004), and the
amplitude in V is larger still, ∼0.9 mag. Sterken & Jaschek (1996) noted that V -band amplitudes of
classical ellipsoidal variables rarely exceed 0.1 mag, with an upper limit of ∼0.4 mag, and their sample
light curves show that photometric amplitudes of ellipsoidals are roughly the same size at all visible

wavelengths. The diﬀering amplitudes across V RI observed in V1835 Aql can not be explained by
simple variations in eﬀective surface area due to viewing a tidally-distorted star at varying orbital
phases (Leahy & Leahy 2015). Similarly, the sinusoidally-varying V − I color of V1835 Aql shown
in the lower panel of Figure 3 is diﬃcult to explain in a tidally distorted star as described above.
We would expect the color to be reddest when the primary star’s cool tidal tip is pointed toward us
during the deeper light curve minimum, and bluest when it is pointing away during the shallower
minimum. Together, the size of the amplitudes and the timing of the color-curve leads us to infer
that V1835 Aql is not a simple ellipsoidal variable with an orbital period of 838 d.
The sinusoidal color variations are more in-keeping with a SySt system in which a hot, compact
component with a surrounding ionized nebula orbits a cool red giant star. One color cycle would
thus correspond to one orbital cycle of Porb = 419 d, with the object appearing brightest and bluest
when the hot nebula is visible; the object would gradually appear fainter and redder as the nebula
rotates out of view behind the cool red giant.
Figure 4 shows the star’s light and color curves phased with the 419-d period. No sharp-edged
eclipses like those seen in Figures 9 and 10 of Gromadzki et al. (2013) are evident. This suggests
that the orbital inclination is too small for the compact object to pass behind the red giant, or that
the luminosity of the compact object relative to the red giant is too low to produce an eclipse (or
both). However, the inclination is suﬃcient for the red giant to partially obscure the luminous nebula
during the orbital cycle, thus causing the principal modulation in the light and color curves.
Evidence of a very shallow dimming episode is visible at φ = 0.5; it appears as a dip in I but
only ﬂattens the top of the V and R curves. Modeling the light curves with VStar suggests a
sinusoid with Porb /2 and an amplitude of 0.08 mag matches the light curves in V RI (as shown by
the solid curves in Figure 4), leaving the V − I color as an unaﬀected sinusoid. This behavior is very
similar to that seen in the multi-band light curves of YY Her (Mikolajewska et al. 2002) and LT Del
(Munari et al. 2021), in which secondary dips of ∼0.1 mag are seen at φ = 0.5 in the V RI passbands;
their overall range of variation increases in passbands at shorter wavelengths, so that the dip merely
ﬂattens the peak of the underlying sinusoid in B and (for YY Her) does not aﬀect it perceptibly in

U. In the photometry of another system, T CrB, the secondary minimum is deeper and is clearly
visible in B as well as in V RI (Munari et al. 2021), whereas in our photometry of V1835 Aql, the dip
is shallower and is clearly visible only in I. In summary, the dips are seen in the redder passbands
for all these objects, but the extent to which dips remain visible at shorter wavelengths varies from
one object to the next.

The Symbiotic Nova V1835 Aql

17

Such secondary dips in SySt are widely attributed to ellipsoidal variations caused by the asymmetrical tidal distortion of the red giant star (see Mikolajewska et al. (2002), Munari et al. (2021)
and references therein). Because of their primarily geometric cause, the depth of the ellipsoidal dips
is roughly constant with wavelength in a given star, as shown for classical ellipsoidal variables in
Sterken & Jaschek (1996). Meanwhile, the principle sinusoidal behavior, caused by varying visibility
of the hot nebular material over the course of an orbit, tends to be stronger in shorter wavelengths,
and thus dominates the ellipsoidal modulation in the blue. The degree to which the irradiated nebula
or the red giant photosphere dominates the light curve in a given passband, say V , likely depends
on the temperature and luminosity of the nebular material, which in turn depends on the luminosity
of the hot, compact stellar component that irradiates it. Munari et al. (2021) and Gromadzki et al.
(2013) show V -band light curves of a number of SySt that express a range of primary (nebular) and
secondary (ellipsoidal) modulation, which indicates a range of luminosities in the compact stars across
these systems. Indeed, the systems with stronger nebular emission and larger blue amplitudes have
been associated with white dwarfs that fuse the material accreted from the red giant continuously, as
soon as it reaches the surface (nuclear burning-type, burn-SySt), whereas the white dwarfs in the systems where the ellipsoidal modulation of the red giant dominates are thought to be powered solely
by the gravitational energy of accretion (accreting-only, or accr -SySt), according to Munari et al.
(2021) and references therein. Because of the strong nebular modulation seen in V1835 Aql, we place
this system among the more commonly-observed burn-SySt subclass. It is intriguing that this system
also produced a strong nova-like outburst observed in 1903 (Williams 2005).
Because the secondary, ellipsoidal dip should be more evident at longer wavelengths, we advocate
for new time-series observations of V1835 Aql in the near infrared. Also, obtaining UB photometry
over the full orbital cycle would verify our ﬁnding that the ellipsoidal modulation is dominated by the
nebular emission at theses energies, and enable a more quantitative ﬂux model of the type performed
by Mikolajewska et al. (2002) on YY Her. In addition, radial velocities obtained at diﬀerent orbital
phases would help to conﬁrm the 419-d orbital period rather than twice this (ELL variable), and
could also lead to mass estimates for the two stars as shown by Mikolajewska (2003a).

18

Caddy et al.

The variations of V1835 Aql appear quite regular from cycle to cycle, indicating that variability
of the red giant due to chromospheric (starspot) activity or pulsational Mira-like behavior, often
seen in symbiotic variables (e.g., Angeloni et al. (2014)), is small, .0.1 mag. This is consistent
with V1835 Aql being an S-type (stellar), rather than the rarer D-type (dusty), symbiotic system
(Mikolajewska 2003a). The infrared colors of V1835 Aql listed in Table 2, when corrected for interstellar reddening, are also in good agreement with those of normal M3-4 giants (Kučinskas et al.
2005), indicating that we are viewing the photosphere of the red giant in V1835 Aql rather than its
circumstellar dust, and thus it is a SySt of S-type.
We determined the median BV RI magnitudes and light curve extrema from Figure 4, and report
them in Table 4, where the brightest and faintest 2% of the data points were eliminated to reduce
the eﬀects of outliers and photometric scatter. The column labeled Rf shows the photometric range
in ﬁlter f as the diﬀerence between the faintest and brightest magnitudes listed.
The parallax-based distance for V1835 Aql shown in Table 2 has large uncertainties, indicating that
this star remains outside the eﬀective range of Gaia trigonometric parallaxes as of EDR3, though
this situation may improve as future data releases become available. We can estimate the distance to
V1835 Aql from the V magnitudes in Table 4, the reddening E(B − V ) = 0.67 mag (Wehrung et al.
2013), and an absolute magnitude of −0.7 mag based on the M3-4 spectral type (Wehrung et al.
2013). While the uncertainties in these values are large, we estimate that V1835 Aql lies 8-11 kpc
from the Sun, 5–6 kpc from the Galactic center and about 0.6 kpc below the Galactic plane. We also
note that an upper limit on the distance can be obtained by assuming the red giant ﬁlls its Roche
lobe; following the arguments in Mikolajewska et al. (2002) for YY Her, one ﬁnds that V1835 Aql
must lie within ∼15 kpc of the Sun.
5. THE LIGHT CURVES OF OTHER VARIABLE STARS

In Figure 5, we show the V magnitude as a function of time for several variable stars that display a range of properties. Most of the variables discussed in Wehrung et al. (2013) are labeled
“[WLR2013] #” in the AAVSO’s Variable Star Index (VSX) using the same identiﬁcation number
listed herein.

A table showing the median and extreme light curve values in each bandpass is presented in the
Supplement. The extrema were computed at the 2% and 98% points of the magnitude-sorted data
sets to reduce the eﬀects of outlier points and photometric scatter. We deﬁne the range of variation,
Rf , as the diﬀerence between the extrema in a particular ﬁlter f . In many studies this is termed the
amplitude, but since many of the stars studied here have irregular behaviors, we reserve that term
for the sinusoids in the Fourier period analysis. As is usually seen for pulsating stars, we found that
RV > RI for most of the stars in our sample.
Upon inspecting the light curves, it is clear that most of the stars are red, long period variables
similar to those observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud by Soszyński et al. (2013). We present in
Table 5 the three periods (P1 , P2 , and P3 in days) and their sinusoidal half-amplitudes (A1 , A2 , and
A3 in mag) with the largest power as determined from the V data for each star using the discrete
Fourier transform software VStar (Benn 2012). We excluded from Table 5 periods that are aliases
of stronger periods. The semi-amplitudes are closely correlated with the power metric output by
VStar, so larger amplitudes indicate higher power and more likely periods. We include the range,
RV , in the second column of Table 5 for comparison with the amplitudes. In some cases, a light
curve modeled using the three highest-power sinusoids does not account for all the variation seen in
the observed light curve, indicating additional sources of natural variation that may include more

periods operating in the star, the presence of truly irregular (chaotic) pulsation, magnetic starspot
activity, convective cells, or absorption by varying amounts of circumstellar dust. Other stars, like
#27, have a single period that dominates the power spectrum. The periods listed in bold are the
ones we ﬁnd are most successful in characterizing each star’s light curve.

The Symbiotic Nova V1835 Aql

21

In the following subsections, we highlight several stars in each of four broad categories. A detailed
discussion of each star, along with V -band light curves of stars not shown in Figure 5, are presented
in the Supplement.

5.1. High amplitude, regular LPVs
Variable star #27 has an extremely red mean color and was detected by the Infrared Astronomical
Satellite (IRAS). We found it to have a large V -band range of 3.31 mag and slow variations as shown
in Figure 5 with a VStar period of 426 d, indicating that it is a Mira-type LPV. This star was
also detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (Shappee et al. 2014) as ASASSNV J190737.43+000609.1 and Jayasinghe et al. (2018) classiﬁed it as a semi-regular variable with a
period of 414.94 d, mean V = 15.42 mag and amplitude ∆V = 1.05 mag. We suspect that the low
spatial resolution of their survey resulted in blending of light with nearby stars, causing a magnitude
0.7 mag brighter than ours and a diluted amplitude. We assert that our photometric properties and
classiﬁcation as a Mira variable are preferrable.
Star #62 shows a relatively large range of RV = 0.91 mag and regular pulsation in Figure 5. We
ﬁnd two dominant periods at 61.8 and 514 days, which may represent the primary pulsation period
and a long secondary period (LSP), respectively. We classify this star as a classical semi-regular LPV
(SRA).

5.2. Lower amplitude, multi-periodic LPVs
Many of the variable stars have red colors but lower photometric ranges (RV ) and show irregular
light curve behavior in which VStar ﬁnds evidence for multiple periods with low-amplitudes. We
classify these stars (#1, #26, #244, #255, #992, #995, #996, and #988) as semi-regular LPVs of
the SRB type. Many of them show evidence of long secondary periods, as noted in the comments
column of Table 5.
Several of these stars are noteworthy. For example, the bright variable #1 shows evidence for
three periods in the 30-50 d range, one of which (34.7 d) is conﬁrmed using data from the All-Sky

Automated Survey (Pojmański & Maciejewski 2004). A lower-power period of ∼334 d also appears
in both data sets, which may be an LSP.
Two stars, #244 (see Figure 5) and #995, have two relatively strong periods in the 300-600 d
range, where one more typically ﬁnds higher amplitude, Mira-like pulsation (Soszyński et al. 2013).
We speculate that these stars may exhibit two LSPs each. While we are not aware of any such stars
in the literature, it is a possibility under the hypothesis promoted by Soszyński et al. (2021) that the
LSP phenomenon is due to obscuration by a dust cloud surrounding and trailing a very low-mass
companion orbiting the red giant. In the cases of stars #244 and #995, we propose the presence of
two such companions with orbital periods corresponding to the LSPs of each star.
Variable #996 appears to be a multi-periodic SRB with an LSP. It was also detected by
Jayasinghe et al. (2018) as ASASSN-V J190742.80+000440.5 and classiﬁed as an SR-type LPV with
a period of 29.23 d, mean V = 15.19 mag, and amplitude ∆V = 0.28 mag. Our VStar analysis
found a period of 29.3 d at the eighth-ranked peak in our power spectrum, raising the possibility
that pulsation activity shifts energy between diﬀerent modes over time in this star. As was the case
for star #27, our median magnitude (V = 15.44 mag) is fainter and our range is larger, consistent
with blended light aﬀecting the ASAS-SN photometry of #996.
5.3. Bluer, non-LPV variables
Three variables shown in the CMD (Figure 1) are signiﬁcantly bluer than the other variables found
in this ﬁeld. Star #991, the reddest of the three, appears to be a ellipsoidal variable (ELL) with
an orbital period of 157 d and E0 = 2, 456, 803 d, composed of at least one red giant. Star #987
is a contact eclipsing binary (W Ursae Majoris, EW-type) with an orbital period of 0.36592 d and
E0 = 2, 456, 803.425 d. Variable #993 is extremely blue, but classifying the star deﬁnitively proved
diﬃcult: the phased light curves are equally good for a pulsating variable with a period of 15.11 d
(E0 = 2, 456, 803.7 d) or of 0.93551 d, or an ellipsoidal/binary star with an orbital period of 1.87102 d
(E0 = 2, 456, 802.94 d). More data taken with a higher sampling rate are needed to clarify the nature
of #993, and spectra could indicate whether it is a S Doradus star, Wolf-Rayet star, or luminous
blue variable. Light curves phased with theses ephemerides are shown in the Supplement.

24

Caddy et al.
5.4. Variables in the wider fields

Though the lower spatial resolution and shorter time span of the images in the BGSU and P1AU
data sets make them less-suitable for detecting variables than the P5AA set, their ﬁelds of view cover
more than ﬁve times the area so their analysis yielded additional variable stars. The bottom panel
of Figure 5 shows the relatively short time span of each of these data sets and the long gap between
them. Given the reduction in data, we focused our detection on stars with slow, correlated variations
in V and I, and our VStar analysis on the strongest period in each star. We were also less ambitious
in our eﬀort to characterize each star’s variability type, and acknowledge that many variables with
shorter periods remain undetected in this region.
In the original Wehrung et al. (2013) paper, we detected three LPVs in this region, #85, #132,
and #419, but were unable to characterize their behaviors. With the additional data from the P1AU
images, we were able to obtain period estimates for all three. The former two stars have short periods
of 42-43 d and can be classiﬁed as semi-regular (SR) variables. Data for #419 suggests a period of
∼185 d and a large amplitude near the RV = 2.5 mag border that separates SRA from Mira LPVs,
though for now we classify it as SRA type.
Among the six new variables detected in the P1AU data set, four appear to be SR or SRB types
with modest photometric ranges and evidence of one or more periods (#105, #154, #184, and #358).
Two stars (#270 and #451) have longer periods and larger ranges, near the borderline between SRA
and Mira LPVs, but we classify them provisionally as SRA until photometry across more pulsation
cycles is obtained. Our light curve for star #451 is shown in Figure 5.
Two of these six variables were also detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae
(Shappee et al. 2014).

Our star #270 is the same as ASASSN-V J190726.81-000347.7, which

Jayasinghe et al. (2018) found to have mean V = 15.09 mag, amplitude ∆V = 1.15 mag, period
79.51 d and to be a semi-regular variable. Our periods agree extremely well, but as in previous cases,
the ASAS-SN mean magnitude is brighter and amplitude is smaller than ours, suggesting that stellar
image blending has aﬀected their photometry. Star #105 is ASASSN-V J190813.72+000019.4 and
Jayasinghe et al. (2018) list it with mean V = 14.77 mag, V amplitude 0.27 mag and an irregular

“L” classiﬁcation with no discernible period. The ASAS-SN photometry agrees well with ours for
this star, which has no bright stars nearby on our images that might eﬀect the photometry. Our
data shows low-amplitude periodic behavior at 24 d and 139 d, enabling us to classify it as an SR
pulsator.
6. SUMMARY

We obtained time-series CCD photometry in the BV RI passbands of the recently identiﬁed
symbiotic nova V1835 Aql over an interval of 5.1 years. The star varies through a magnitude
range of RV ≈ 0.9 mag and RI ≈ 0.3 mag with a regular cycle described by the ephemeris
JDmin = (419 ± 10) Ncyc + (2, 456, 834 ± 10) d. This orbital period is relatively short for a SySt,
ranking eighth of 53 objects in the distribution given by Gromadzki et al. (2013). No sharp-edged
stellar eclipses are evident. We see a dip at φ = 0.5 in the light curve shown in Figure 4 that we
attribute to tidal distortion of the giant star and the consequent ellipsoidal eﬀect on the light curve.
This hints that V1835 Aql may transfer some of its mass to the hot component via Roche lobe overﬂow (Mikolajewska 2003b), rather than the more widely-accepted model of stellar wind transfer. We
show that any intrinsic variation of the red giant, for example caused by pulsation, is weak; this, and
the dereddened near-infrared color of the red giant, are consistent with V1835 Aql being a S-type
(stellar) SySt. The strong photometric modulation of the object in the bluer passbands suggests
that the compact stellar object that irradiates the giant star’s wind has a relatively high luminosity,
consistent with fusion of accreted hydrogen continually as it reaches the stellar surface: a burn-SySt.
It is noteworthy that V1835 Aql is among a small number of SySt that have been observed to undergo
a major nove-like outburst (Williams 2005).
We also provide BV RI time series photometry on 22 variable stars in the ﬁeld around V1835 Aql,
nine of which were initially detected in Wehrung et al. (2013). We list the stars’ photometric properties and periods found using Fourier analysis. Most turn out to be long period variable red giants,
including one Mira, four semi-regular (SRA), nine multi-periodic (SRB), and ﬁve LPVs which showed
convincing periodic behavior for which we did not have enough data to classify with conﬁdence (SR).
Many of these stars have long secondary periods (LSPs) and two stars appear to have two LSPs each,

26

which seems viable under the hypothesis that the LSP behavior is caused by dimming due to dust
clouds entrained by orbiting, low-mass companion objects (Soszyński et al. 2021). Detailed analysis
of each star and light curves are provided in the Supplement.
We recommend that V1835 Aql receive additional photometric observations in the near ultraviolet
and near infrared regions (e.g., UB, JHK) in order to conﬁrm the ellipsoidal variations suspected
herein, and to quantify its physical properties. Spectroscopic radial velocity measurements over all
phases of the light curve would also conﬁrm the orbital period and perhaps provide a mass ratio
as shown in Mikolajewska (2003a) We also note that many of these stars, including V1835 Aql,
are receiving ongoing optical photometric monitoring by the Zwicky Transient Facility (Bellm et al.
2019) and the Gaia astrometric satellite (Gaia Collaboration 2016).

1. OVERVIEW

For each of the 22 variable stars discussed in Section 5 of the main paper, we determined the
median and extreme light curve values in each bandpass, shown here in Table 1. The extrema were
computed at the 2% and 98% points of the magnitude-sorted data sets to reduce the eﬀects of outlier
points and photometric scatter. The range of variation in ﬁlter f , Rf , is the diﬀerence between the
extrema; we reserve the term amplitude for the sinusoids in the Fourier period analysis.
As described in the main text, we used the discrete Fourier transform method implemented in
VStar to identify periods in our time-series data. We began the analysis of each star by plotting
the V and I magnitudes as a function of time (the data are available electronically through Table 3
of the main paper). Stars with slow light variation like long period variables (LPVs) are apparent in
such plots, and so we proceeded to run a VStar search on the interval 10-1000 days with 0.1-day
resolution on the V -band data, and focused attention on the periods with the highest power. We
identiﬁed aliases in the usual way, and removed the period in an alias-pair that had the lower power
from further consideration. We selected the three periods with the highest power as most likely
including the actual period of variation of the star. For stars whose time-magnitude plots showed
scatter, consistent with a period shorter than our sampling rate, we searched for periods using the
interval described above, then tested a 1-10 d interval with 0.0001 d resolution, and then 0.1-1.0 d
at 0.00001 d.
In the ﬁrst of the following sections, we consider the stars identiﬁed in the ﬁrst paper in this series;
their light curves are shown in Figure 1. In Section 3 we discuss the variables that were discovered
in the new PROMPT 4 data sets, with their light curves are shown in Figures 1 and 3. Finally, we
cover the most convincing variable star candidates found in the PROMPT 1 data set in Sec. 4, with
light curves in Figure 4.

2. VARIABLES REPORTED BY WEHRUNG ET AL. (2013)

Star #1, listed in the VSX as “[WLR2013] 1,” has an irregular appearing light curve with a
range of 0.45 mag in V and a rather red mean color of hV i − hIi = 4.34 mag (see Figure 1). The
top three periods found using VStar on our V -band data (49.5, 34.8, and 47.3 days) all have
signiﬁcant power (the power spectrum from VStar is shown in Figure 2), but when modeled do
not account for all the variation seen in the observed light curve, suggesting that more periods or
causes of variability are at play. This star was also observed by the All-Sky Automated Survey
(ASAS, Pojmański & Maciejewski (2004)). A VStar analysis of that data yielded 289.8 d, 31.6 d,
and 34.6 d, all with semi-amplitudes of ∼0.055 mag. The 34-day period appears in both data sets,
and the 31-d period is an alias of this value. A longer, 334-day period shows up with an amplitude
of ∼0.04 mag in both data sets, and may represent a long secondary period (LSP). Star #1 appears
to be a multi-periodic semi-regular LPV (SRB), with periods of 49.5 and 34.7 days expressed most
strongly. We calculate the absolute magnitude of star #1 to be MV = −0.1 mag based on the median
magnitude in Table 1 and the distance in Table 2 of the main paper, along with E(B −V ) = 0.67 mag.
Star #26: This variable star, called “[WLR2013] 26” in the VSX, is slightly bluer than Star #1
at hV i − hIi = 3.75 mag, and has a larger range of 0.58 mag in V . The three non-aliased periods
with the highest power are 70.2, 73.6 and 348 days. The latter is likely to be a LSP, and the 70.2 d
period is the dominant period, describing much of the observed variation, making star #26 a rather
classical semi-regular variable. When added to the VStar model, the 73.6 d period interacts with
the 70.2 d period to account for some the amplitude variation seen in the light curve, supporting the
idea that this star is truly multi-periodic, and so we classify it as SRB. We estimate MV = −1.2 mag
for star #26 using the data described in the previous paragraph.
Star #27: This variable did not appear in the VSX listing with the other WLR13 stars. It is
extremely red, hV i − hIi = 5.98 mag, and was detected by the IRAS infrared satellite. We found
it to have large V -band range of 3.31 mag and slow variations with a VStar period of 426 d, as
shown in Figure 5 of the main text, properties that indicate it is a Mira-type LPV. Star #27 was also
detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (Shappee et al. 2014) which observed in

the V -band with a 2-3 d cadence between Julian dates 2,457,100 and 2,458,400 days, as ASASSN-V
J190737.43+000609.1. Jayasinghe et al. (2018) classiﬁed the star as a semi-regular variable with a
period of 414.94 d, a mean V = 15.42 mag and amplitude ∆V = 1.05 mag from observations spanning
over two full cycles. While our periods agree well, we suspect that the low spatial resolution of their
survey resulted in blending of light with nearby stars, causing a brighter magnitude (we found

of our period detection methodology for long-period variable stars.

a median V of 16.15 mag) and diluted amplitude, and we therefore assert that our photometric
properties and classiﬁcation as a Mira variable are correct. We estimate MV = +1.6 mag for star #27,
which seems faint for an LPV; we look to improved parallaxes in upcoming Gaia data releases to
resolve this issue.
Star #62: This variable, named “[WLR2013] 62” in the VSX, presents two strong periods in
VStar at 61.8 and 514 days, which account for most of the light curve variations and likely represent
the primary pulsation period and an LSP. This star is rather red, hV i − hIi = 4.13 mag, and has
a relatively large range in V of 0.91 mag, characteristic of a classical semi-regular LPV (SRA). The
star’s strongly periodic nature, modulated perhaps by other periods (64.8 and 55.3 d have moderate
power in our analysis), is evident in the light curve shown in Figure 5 of the main text. We estimate
MV = −0.9 mag for star #62.
Star #244: The color and range of this variable, also known as “WLR2013] 244,” are 3.63 and
1.18 mag respectively, similar to that of #62. The light curve of star #244, which is also shown
in Figure 5, has a deep and prolonged dip at JD ≈ 2,456,500 d that could be attributed to a dust
obscuration episode. The VStar analysis indicates strong periods at 471 and 337 days whose minima

8

Caddy et al.

coincide at this dip. Ignoring two additional periods at 179 and 210 d which are close to aliases of the
ﬁrst two periods, the next strongest period is at 67.3 d. Including this in a model with 471 and 377 d
accounts for much of the variability seen in the light curve, though we note that a number of other
periods are present with similar power, including one at 117 d that improves the modeled light curve.
We propose that the 67.3 d period is the dominant pulsation period of this semi-regular LPV, and
that two LSPs are present in this star. While we are not aware of any LPVs with multiple LSPs, it is
a possibility under the hypothesis promoted by Soszyński et al. (2021) that the LSP phenomenon is
due to obscuration by a dust cloud surrounding and trailing a very low-mass companion orbiting the
red giant. In the case of star #244, we propose the presence of two companions with orbital periods
of 377 and 471 d, respectively.
Star #255 or “[WLR2013] 255,” is similar to #244 in color (3.70 mag), but has a smaller RV =
0.48 mag (see Figure 1). The two strongest periods of 603 and 45.4 d likely indicate the LSP and
pulsation periods of this semi-regular variable. The 35.4 d period and several others of similar length
and power may modulate the amplitude over time, and so we classify this star as an SRB.
The Wehrung et al. (2013) stars #85, 132 and 419 had relatively few observations because they
were outside the narrower PROMPT ﬁelds of view, and were only observed using the BGSU and
P1AU telescopes. They are discussed in Sec. 4.

3. NEW VARIABLES DETECTED BY THE NARROW FIELD IMAGERS

Star #991: At hV i − hIi = 1.90 mag, this newly-detected variable star is signiﬁcantly bluer than
any of the stars described in the previous section, appearing near the blue edge of the non-variable
red giant stars shown in Figure 1 of the main text. Its V -band light curve is quite regular, and
our VStar analysis shows that a single period at 78.6 d describes most of the observed variation.
The light curve phased with twice this period, to represent an orbital period, looks similar to the
light curves of ellipsoidal red giants detected in the Large Magellanic Cloud shown in Figure 1 of
Soszyński et al. (2004). The period, I-band amplitude, and dereddened color are also consistent with
the distributions of these properties in the sample of Soszyński et al. (2004). We therefore classify

The Symbiotic Nova V1835 Aql

9

star #991 as an ellipsoidal (ELL-type) red giant variable. We estimate MV = −0.4 mag, and show
its phased light curve in Figure 3 using the ephemeris JDmin = (157.2) × Ncyc + 2, 456, 803 d.
Star #992 is another very red variable, hV i − hIi = 4.56 mag, with a moderate photometric range
of RV = 0.71 mag. Period analysis on the V -band data showed evidence of periodicity at 38.1, 104,
51.5, and 685 days (the middle two are suspiciously close to a 2:1 ratio, and the latter may be an
LSP), though the power spectra included many peaks only slightly less strong. We therefore ran the
I-band data through VStar and obtained strongest power at 53.1, 51.1 and 38.0 days (there is a
weaker period at 606 d that may correspond to the longest period from V ). We therefore advocate
periods of 38.1 and 51.3 days, with a possible LSP around 650 days, and suspect that the star is a
SRB variable.
Variable #993 is extremely blue, hV i − hIi = 0.80 mag, and is among the brightest stars in the
strip of main sequence stars shown in Figure 1 of the main text. The standard search on the LPV
period range of 10-1000 d yielded a strong peak at 15.109 d, which might indicate that #993 is a WolfRayet or S Doradus star (it is phased in Figure 3 with this period and E0 = 2, 456, 803.7 d). An optical
spectrum is required to conﬁrm this classiﬁcation. Experience with similar stars in Abbas et al. (2015)
indicates that this star could be a W Ursae Majoris contact binary, so we tested periods from 0.110 d and found a period at 0.93551 d with higher power. Phased light curves with this and the
15-d period appeared similarly good, with the data points scattering evenly around the sine-shaped
models. Doubling the shorter period to recreate the behavior of a W UMa star showed minima with
slightly diﬀerent depths, suggesting that 1.87102 d represents the orbital period of this star (phased
with E0 = 2, 456, 802.94 d in Figure 3), in good agreement with the phased light curves of W UMa
stars shown in Sterken & Jaschek (1996). However, the period is relatively long for a contact binary,
and the absolute magnitude of MV = −0.7 mag seems overly luminous (yet underluminous for a WR
or SDOR star). Additional data are needed to classify this star with conﬁdence.
Variable #995 has a moderate mean color of hV i − hIi = 2.81 mag and a narrow range of
variability, RV = 0.15 mag. Analysis with VStar indicates two long periods of 602 and 284 days
which are apparent individually in the star’s light curve, and when combined, match nicely most

of the star’s long timescale excursions. The shorter period of 21.1 days can be seen in a phased
light curve, and may represent the star’s pulsation period in a low-amplitude, higher harmonic mode
typical of OSARG pulsation described by Soszyński et al. (2013). We propose that this star is an SRB
and the two long periods are LSPs, analogous to the case of star #244. We estimate MV = −2.0 mag
for star #995.

Star #996 has a red color, hV i − hIi = 3.92 mag, and modest range of RV = 0.47 mag. VStar
ﬁnds two shorter periods, 42.0 and 42.8 days, which are not aliased, and which, when combined,
interfere to produce a slowly-varying amplitude that approximates that seen in the observed light
curve. Adding the longer period at 310 days improves the light curve model even more. We thus
suggest that star #996 is a double-mode semi-regular (SRB) variable with an LSP. This star was
also detected by Jayasinghe et al. (2018) as ASASSN-V J190742.80+000440.5 and classiﬁed as an
SR-type LPV with a period of 29.23 d, mean V = 15.19 mag, and amplitude ∆V = 0.28 mag. Our
VStar analysis found a period of 29.3 d at the eighth-ranked peak in the power spectrum, raising
the possibility that pulsation activity shifts energy between diﬀerent modes over time in this star. As
was the case for star #27, our median magnitude (V = 15.44 mag) is fainter and our range is larger,
consistent with blended light aﬀecting the ASAS-SN photometry. We estimate MV = −1.0 mag for
star #996.
Star #987: Like star #993, our new variable #987 has a blue color of hV i − hIi = 1.36 mag that
places it on the strip of main sequence stars shown on the CMD in Figure 1 of the main paper. The
star has a moderate photometric range of RV = 0.72 mag, much of which is explained by the strong
period found at 0.18296 d. The resulting phased light curve is quite sine-shaped, and doubling the
period gives a light curve with eclipses of similar depth typical of a W Ursae Majoris contact binary
with a period of 0.36592 d, as shown in Figure 3 (where it is phased with E0 = 2, 456, 803.425 d).
This classiﬁcation is consistent with our estimate of MV = +3.3 mag.
Star #988: This variable is red, hV i − hIi = 3.70 mag, and of moderate range, RV = 0.49 mag.
The ﬁrst three periods from VStar (41.8, 32.9, and 104 days), when combined, provide a model
that explains many of the features in the time-magnitude plot. A longer period of 699 d with a
similar amplitude improves the match between the model and observed data. We classify this star
as a multii-periodic semi-regular (SRB) with a possible LSP.
4. VARIABLES DETECTED BY THE WIDE FIELD IMAGERS

Though the lower spatial resolution and shorter time span of the images in the P1AU data set
make it less-suitable for detecting variable stars than the P5AA set, its ﬁeld of view covers more

12

Caddy et al.

than ﬁve times the area so it may contain additional variable stars. The time span and observing
cadence make it diﬃcult to determine periods of variables with periods less than about 30 days –
these stars’ time-magnitude plots would show scatter which could not be corroborated as real by the
process of ﬁnding the period and producing a phased light curve showing clear cyclic behavior as was
done for the stars #993 and #987 in the previous section. Therefore, we focus our attention on the
detection of stars that show slow, correlated variations in V and I in their time-magnitude plots, as
well as large values of the Welch & Stetson (1993) variability index and large light variations. We
acknowledge the resulting bias towards ﬁnding long period variable stars, as well as our prioritization
of red color and uncrowded environment.
Because the BG and P1 data sets alone provided far fewer points and less time coverage, in most
cases we only present the single best period from the VStar analysis. The long observational gap
between the BG and P1 data sets (∼1400 days) created a “picket fence” of closely-spaced periods in
the power spectrum with the interval between periods related to the addition or removal of a periodic
cycle of the star during the gap. We selected the period with the highest power, but acknowledge
that this choice may be inﬂuenced by unidentiﬁed aliases, and that more data is required to obtain
deﬁnitive periods for the following stars.
Star #085 was discovered in the BGSU data presented in Wehrung et al. (2013) and is listed in
the VSX as “[WLR2013] 85.” Here we add the star’s data from the P1AU set and determine its mean
color to be hV i − hIi = 4.10 mag and its photometric range to be RV = 0.40 mag. Using VStar
we ﬁnd the period with the most power to be 42 d with a sinusoidal amplitude of 0.090 mag. These
properties are consistent with star #085 being a semi-regular (SR) long period variable.
Variable #132, or “[WLR2013] 132,” is a very red star with hV i − hIi = 4.50 mag and a range of
RV = 0.42 mag. A single, clear period at 43 days indicates it is probably a semi-regular LPV (SR).
Star #419, or “[WLR2013] 419,” is also quite red, with hV i − hIi = 4.29 mag and a large range of
at least RV = 1.83 mag that is best seen in the new P1AU data as a slow decline, minimum and rise
spanning less than one full light cycle. The best period is 185 d, which, by itself, explains most of
the variation in the available data. When several cycles of this stars pulsation are well mapped, we

suspect the amplitude may be near or above the RV = 2.5 mag limit used to separate semi-regular
from Mira long period variables. Until then, we classify it as a SRA variable.
Star #105: This newly-detected variable star has a red color of hV i − hIi = 3.43 mag and a range
of RV = 0.27 mag. A period of 24 days (A = 0.046 mag) and one with 139 d (A = 0.054 mag) had
similar power, and could represent a pulsation period and LSP in this SR variable. This star was also

14

Caddy et al.

detected by Jayasinghe et al. (2018) as ASASSN-V J190813.72+000019.4 with mean V = 14.77 mag,
V amplitude 0.27 mag and an irregular “L” classiﬁcation with no discernible period. The ASAS-SN
photometry agrees well with ours for this star, which has no bright stars nearby on our images that
might compromise photometry. We estimate MV = −1.3 mag.
Star #154 is another new variable detected in the P1AU data set whose red color of hV i − hIi =
4.21 mag and range of RV = 0.48 mag suggest it is another semi-regular LPV. Our VStar analysis
support this interpretation with strong power at periods of 43 d and 73 d that do a good job of
matching the observed light curve, leading us to think the star is a multi-periodic pulsator (SRB).
We estimate MV = −0.1 mag.
Star #184: This new variable is red (hV i − hIi = 3.42 mag) with RV = 0.36 mag and a single
period of 54 d. It is probably a SR variable.
Star #270 is the same as ASASSN-V J190726.81-000347.7 which Jayasinghe et al. (2018) found
to have mean V = 15.09 mag, amplitude ∆V = 1.15 mag, period 79.51 d, and to be a semi-regular
variable. In our data, #270 is red (hV i − hIi = 3.37 mag but has a larger range of RV = 1.97 mag
and dimmer mean magnitude (15.18 mag) than the ASAS-SN results, suggesting that blending with
nearby stars of constant brightness may have diluted the ASAS-SN light curve somewhat. Our
VStar period of 79.6 d is very strong and is in excellent agreement with that of ASAS-SN. We
classify #270 as a SRA-type LPV but note that its strong, high-amplitude variation is near the
threshold to be considered a Mira. We estimate MV = −0.9 mag for star #270.
Variable #358 is quite red, with hV i − hIi = 4.69 mag, and RV = 0.52 mag. The strongest power
is at a period of 243 d, which describes the slower variation in the P1AU data, and the addition of a
weaker period of 60 d accounts for much of the short-timescale variations. We tentatively attribute
them to an LSP and the pulsation period, respectively, and classify the star as a semi-regular variable
(SR).
Star #451 has an extremely red color of hV i − hIi = 5.49 mag and a range that is likely larger
than the value RV = 1.15 mag we report. The BGSU data are noisy and do little to constrain the
star’s period, while during the P1AU data set the star rose steadily from V ≈ 17.75 mag and past

a peak at V ≈ 16.95 mag, covering less than a full cycle (see Figure 5 of the main paper). VStar
provides several periods with similar power (733, 489, 368, 295, and 250 d in declining order of power
and amplitude) and we cannot distinguish which is correct. We suspect the star may be a Mira LPV,
but until more photometry is available to reﬁne the period and amplitude, we provisionally classify
#451 as a SRA variable.
