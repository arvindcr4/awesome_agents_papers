Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "arXiv:2106.01345v2 [cs.LG] 24 Jun 2021  Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling  Lili Chen∗,1 , Kevin Lu∗,1 , Aravind Rajeswaran2 , Kimin Lee1 , Aditya Grover2 , Michael Laskin1 , Pieter Abbeel1 , Aravind Srinivas†,1 , Igor Mordatch†,3 ∗ equal contribution † equal advising 1  UC Berkeley  2  Facebook AI Research  3  Google Brain  {lilichen, kzl}@berkeley.edu  Abstract We introduce a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem."
- "In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 10_offline_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as offline, batch, dataset, matching the research direction's core themes.
