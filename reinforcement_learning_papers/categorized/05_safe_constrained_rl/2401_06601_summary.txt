**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the utility of data protected by Global Differential Privacy (DP) in the scenario of summary statistics. The approach is based on predictions on how an analyst will use statistics released under DP protection, so that a developer can optimize data utility on further usage of the data in the privacy budget allocation. A metric is also proposed to compare different budget allocations and find the optimal solution that minimizes the noise.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* A novel approach to improve data utility in DP by predicting how an analyst will use statistics released under DP protection
* A metric to compare different budget allocations and find the optimal solution that minimizes the noise
* The approach is designed to be used with summary statistics and does not affect the solution privacy
* The potential improvement in utility comes from the budget allocation, and the metric can be used to measure the utility of a specific budget allocation
* Future work includes evaluating the proposed approach through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, and exploring methods to directly find the optimal budget allocation.
