**PAPER:** Multi-turn Reinforcement Learning from Preference Human Feedback
**TITLE:** Multi-turn Reinforcement Learning from Preference Human Feedback
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The authors propose a novel method for multi-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback, which extends the standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approach to handle multi-turn interactions. They introduce a new algorithm called Multi-turn Preference Optimization (MTPO), which uses a mirror descent-based policy optimization algorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the preference-based objective.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The authors propose a novel framework for multi-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback, which can handle complex interactions and long-term goals.
* They introduce the MTPO algorithm, which uses a mirror descent-based policy optimization algorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the preference-based objective.
* The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the MTPO algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of experiments, including a new benchmark called Education Dialogue.
* The authors also compare their approach to other state-of-the-art methods, including single-turn RLHF and multi-turn RLHF, and show that their approach outperforms these methods in many cases.
