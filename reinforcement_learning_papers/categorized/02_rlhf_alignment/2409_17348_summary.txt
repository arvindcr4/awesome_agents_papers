**PAPER:** Language Grounded Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Human-interpretable Communication
**TITLE:** Language Grounded Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Human-interpretable Communication
**ARXIV_ID:** 2409.17348v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel computational pipeline called LangGround, which aligns the communication space of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) agents with an embedding space of human natural language. This is achieved by grounding agent communications on synthetic data generated by embodied Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive teamwork scenarios.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Introduces a new approach to enable MARL agents to learn human-interpretable communication
* Proposes a computational pipeline called LangGround to align agent communication with human language
* Evaluates the performance of LangGround in various environments, including Predator Prey and Urban Search & Rescue (USAR)
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of LangGround in facilitating ad-hoc teamwork between MARL agents and unseen teammates
* Provides a detailed analysis of the learned communication protocols and their properties, including human interpretability, topographic similarity, and zero-shot generalizability.
