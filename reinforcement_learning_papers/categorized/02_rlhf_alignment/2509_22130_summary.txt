**PAPER:** Multi-Agent Path Finding via Offline RL and LLM Collaboration
**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Path Finding via Offline RL and LLM Collaboration
**ARXIV_ID:** 2509.22130v1 [cs.MA]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel decentralized approach to Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) by leveraging offline reinforcement learning and collaboration with Large Language Models (LLMs). The Decision Transformer (DT) architecture is used to model long-horizon dependencies and address the credit assignment problem in MAPF scenarios. The integration of LLMs, specifically GPT-4o, enables dynamic adaptation in MAPF and improves performance in environments subject to real-time changes.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* A novel decentralized offline reinforcement learning approach employing Decision Transformer to solve MAPF efficiently, significantly reducing training time from weeks to mere hours while maintaining robust performance.
* Effective management of the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon MAPF tasks, specifically addressing scenarios with delayed positive rewards at the end.
* The pioneering integration of GPT-4o for dynamic adaptation in MAPF, enabling significant performance improvements in environments subject to real-time changes.
* Comprehensive experimental validation in both static and dynamic scenarios, clearly demonstrating the advantages and practicality of the DT+LLM approach for responsive and adaptive multi-agent systems.
