**TITLE**: Stateful Active Facilitator: Coordination and Environmental Heterogeneity in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

**ARXIV_ID**: 2210.03022v3

**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback Alignment)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: The paper proposes a novel approach called Stateful Active Facilitator (SAF) that enables agents to work efficiently in high-coordination and high-heterogeneity environments. SAF uses a shared knowledge source during training, which learns to sift through and interpret signals provided by all agents before passing them to the centralized critic. The approach also uses a pool of policies that agents can dynamically select from, allowing them to exhibit diverse behaviors and handle heterogeneous environments.

**EXPERIMENTS**: The authors conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of SAF in various environments, including TeamTogether, TeamSupport, and KeyForTreasure. The results show that SAF consistently outperforms the baselines (IPPO and MAPPO) across different tasks and heterogeneity levels.

**CONCLUSION**: The paper concludes that high coordination and heterogeneity do make cooperative tasks challenging, and SAF allows agents to gain better performance in these environments. The authors also highlight the importance of considering coordination and environmental heterogeneity levels in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.
