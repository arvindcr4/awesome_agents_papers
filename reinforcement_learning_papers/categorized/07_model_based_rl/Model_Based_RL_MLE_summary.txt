**PAPER:** Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Action Spaces
**TITLE:** Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Action Spaces
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm called Dynamics Learning and Predictive Control with Parameterized Actions (DLPA). DLPA learns a parameterized-action-conditioned dynamics model and plans with a modified Model Predictive Path Integral control. The algorithm is designed for Parameterized Action Markov Decision Processes (PAMDPs), which extend traditional MDPs by introducing parameterized actions.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The paper proposes a model-based RL algorithm for PAMDPs, which achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to state-of-the-art model-free PAMDP methods.
* The algorithm learns a dynamics model that is conditioned on the parameterized actions and uses a weighted trajectory-level prediction loss.
* The paper provides theoretical performance guarantees for DLPA, including a bound on the regret of the rollout trajectory and a bound on the multi-step prediction error.
* The algorithm is evaluated on 8 standard PAMDP benchmarks and achieves significantly better sample efficiency and asymptotic performance than model-free PAMDP methods.
