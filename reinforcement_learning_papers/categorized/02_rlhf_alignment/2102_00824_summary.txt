**TITLE:** Hammer: Multi-Level Coordination of Reinforcement Learning Agents via Learned Messaging
**ARXIV_ID:** 2102.00824v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces a novel approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) called Hammer, which uses a central agent to learn messages to communicate with independent local agents. The central agent receives a global observation and outputs a message vector for each local agent, which is then used by the local agent to make decisions. The method is designed to work in both discrete and continuous action spaces and with individual or team rewards.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces a new approach to MARL that uses a central agent to learn messages to communicate with independent local agents
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in two multi-agent domains: cooperative navigation and multi-agent walker
* Shows that the approach can generalize to heterogeneous local agents and different reward structures
* Provides a detailed analysis of the method and its performance in various settings
