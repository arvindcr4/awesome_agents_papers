**TITLE:** Bi-level Mean Field: Dynamic Grouping for Large-Scale MARL
**ARXIV_ID:** 2505.06706v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a Bi-level Mean Field (BMF) method for large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). BMF dynamically groups agents based on their extracted hidden features, allowing for a deeper understanding of the relationships between agents. The method introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents, facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Additionally, BMF proposes a bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions for effective neighboring aggregation.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper proposes a novel Bi-level Mean Field (BMF) method for large-scale MARL, which can alleviate interaction aggregation noise while maintaining low computational overhead.
* BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a VAE to learn the representations of agents, facilitating their dynamic grouping over time.
* The method proposes a bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions for effective neighboring aggregation.
* Experiments demonstrate that BMF exhibits strong adaptability across various dynamic large-scale multi-agent environments, outperforming existing methods.
