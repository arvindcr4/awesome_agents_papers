**TITLE:** Robust Communicative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Active Defense
**ARXIV_ID:** 2312.11545v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes an active defense strategy for robust communicative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents judge the reliability of received messages based on their local information and reduce unreliable messages' impact on the final decision. The authors introduce an Active Defense Multi-Agent Communication (ADMAC) framework, which estimates the reliability of received messages and adjusts their impact on the final decision accordingly.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose an active defense strategy for robust communicative multi-agent reinforcement learning.
* They introduce an Active Defense Multi-Agent Communication (ADMAC) framework, which estimates the reliability of received messages and adjusts their impact on the final decision accordingly.
* The authors evaluate the performance of ADMAC alongside three alternative multi-agent communication frameworks in three communication-critical environments under attacks of different kinds and intensities.
* They conduct an ablation study to further explore the features of components in ADMAC.
