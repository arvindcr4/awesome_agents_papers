**TITLE:** Fully Decentralized Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Survey
**ARXIV_ID:** 2401.04934v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper surveys fully decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning methods, which are necessary when centralized modules are not allowed or when the number of agents is dynamically changing. The authors discuss the challenges of fully decentralized learning, including non-stationary environments and the lack of information about other agents. They review existing methods in two settings: maximizing a shared reward and maximizing the sum of individual rewards.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
