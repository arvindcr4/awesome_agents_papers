TITLE: Spatially resolved spectroscopy of alkali metal vapour diffusing inside hollow-core photonic crystal fibres
ARXIV_ID: 2205.06148v1
RESEARCH_METHOD: 07_model_based_rl (Note: This paper is not directly related to Reinforcement Learning, but rather to experimental physics and spectroscopy. However, I've categorized it under model-based RL as it involves modeling and simulation of the atomic density distribution.)

METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The authors present a new type of compact and all-glass based vapour cell integrating hollow-core photonic crystal fibres. They use a 5-level system of Bloch-equations to model the frequency-dependent absorption of the light propagating inside the hollow-core fibre. The authors also measure the fluorescence of the rubidium atoms inside the fibre, which allows them to observe the diffusion of the atoms out of the fibre in real-time and with spatial resolution.

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
- The authors demonstrate a new type of vapour cell that is entirely made out of glass, allowing for fast and homogeneous heating and filling of the fibre with alkali metal vapour.
- They show that the atomic density inside the fibre can be controlled and measured with high precision using a combination of transmission and fluorescence measurements.
- The authors model the frequency-dependent absorption of the light propagating inside the hollow-core fibre using a 5-level system of Bloch-equations, which allows them to retrieve the atomic density distribution along the fibre.
- They demonstrate the ability to measure the diffusion of the atoms out of the fibre in real-time and with spatial resolution using fluorescence measurements.
