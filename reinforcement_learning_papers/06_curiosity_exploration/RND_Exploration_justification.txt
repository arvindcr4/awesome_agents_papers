Abstract Snippet:
E XPLORATION BY R ANDOM N ETWORK D ISTILLATION Yuri Burda∗ OpenAI  Harrison Edwards∗ OpenAI  Amos Storkey Univ. of Edinburgh  Oleg Klimov OpenAI  We introduce an exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning methods that is easy to implement and adds minimal overhead to the computation performed. The bonus is the error of a neural network predicting features of the observations given by a fixed randomly initialized neural network. We also introduce a method to flexibly combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. We find that the random network distillation (RND) bonus combined with this incre...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "of Edinburgh  Oleg Klimov OpenAI  We introduce an exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning methods that is easy to implement and adds minimal overhead to the computation performed."
- "We also introduce a method to flexibly combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 06_curiosity_exploration because it explicitly discusses concepts such as exploration, curiosity, intrinsic, matching the research direction's core themes.
