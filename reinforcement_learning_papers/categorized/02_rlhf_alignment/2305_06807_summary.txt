**PAPER:** Information Design in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Information Design in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2305.06807v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a framework for information design in multi-agent reinforcement learning, where a sender with an informational advantage tries to persuade a self-interested receiver to take actions that benefit the sender. The authors introduce the concept of Markov signaling games and derive a signaling gradient that takes into account the receiver's policy and action. They also propose extended obedience constraints that ensure the receiver's incentive compatibility.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of Markov signaling games to model mixed-motive communication
* Derivation of the signaling gradient that considers the receiver's policy and action
* Proposal of extended obedience constraints to ensure the receiver's incentive compatibility
* Experimental evaluation of the framework in two scenarios: Recommendation Letter and Reaching Goals
* Discussion of the limitations and potential future directions of the work
