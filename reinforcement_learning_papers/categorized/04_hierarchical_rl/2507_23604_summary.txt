**Paper Information**

* Title: Hierarchical Message-Passing Policies for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
* arXiv ID: 2507.23604v1
* Research Method: 04_hierarchical_rl (Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning)

**Method Description**

The paper proposes a novel methodology for learning hierarchies of message-passing policies in multi-agent systems. The decision-making structure relies on a dynamic multi-level hierarchical graph, allowing for improved coordination and planning by leveraging communication and feudal relationships. The proposed reward-assignment method is theoretically sound, and empirical results on different benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

**Key Contributions**

* Introduce a novel method based on Feudal Reinforcement Learning (FRL) for learning multi-level hierarchies of message-passing policies in multi-agent systems.
* Propose a flexible and adaptive reward-assignment scheme that leverages hierarchical graph structures for training multi-level feudal policies.
* Provide theoretical guarantees that the proposed learning scheme generates level-specific reward signals aligned with the global task.

**Experimental Results**

The proposed method, Hierarchical Message-Passing Policy (HiMPo), is evaluated on relevant MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging with Survival (LBFwS) and VMAS Sampling. The results show that HiMPo performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods, including IPPO, MAPPO, and GPPO. HiMPo achieves strong performance in challenging MARL benchmarks where coordination among agents is required.

**Related Work**

The paper discusses related work in multi-agent reinforcement learning, including communication-based methodologies, graph-based methods, and hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches. The authors highlight the limitations of existing methods and demonstrate how HiMPo addresses these challenges.
