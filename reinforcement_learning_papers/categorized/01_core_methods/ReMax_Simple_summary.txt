**TITLE:** Asymptotically uniform functions: a single hypothesis which solves two old problems
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 01_core_methods
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces the concept of asymptotically uniform functions, which are functions that satisfy a certain condition on their asymptotic behavior. The authors show that this concept solves two old problems in mathematics, one related to the vanishing of a derivative at infinity and the other related to the vanishing of an integrand at infinity.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper introduces the concept of asymptotically uniform functions and shows that it is a necessary and sufficient condition for the vanishing of a derivative at infinity.
* The authors prove that the same property is also necessary and sufficient for the vanishing of an integrand at infinity.
* The paper provides a detailed study of asymptotically uniform functions, including their properties and examples.
* The authors show that the class of asymptotically uniform functions can be characterized as those which can be written as the sum of a uniformly continuous function and one which vanishes at infinity.
* The paper extends the differential case to functions with more derivatives and provides a generalization of Hadamard's lemma.
