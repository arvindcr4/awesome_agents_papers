**TITLE**: Dispelling the Mirage of Progress in Offline MARL through Standardised Baselines and Evaluation

**ARXIV_ID**: 2406.09068v3 [cs.LG]

**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 02_rlhf_alignment (The paper analyzes the current state of research in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and identifies methodological shortcomings that hinder progress in the field.)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: The authors conducted a thorough analysis of prior work in offline MARL, identifying significant methodological failures, such as inconsistencies in baselines and evaluation protocols. They propose improving standards in evaluation with a simple protocol, including standardized baselines, datasets, and evaluation methodologies. The authors also provide a comprehensive benchmarking exercise, comparing simple baselines against several proposed state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, showing that their baselines outperform them in most cases.

The paper highlights the importance of transparency, consistency, and completeness in evaluation procedures, which is crucial for comparing and building upon prior work. The authors argue that the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and baselines has slowed progress in the field, allowing for a "mirage of steady progress" while algorithms are not becoming materially better.

**ANALYSIS**:

* The paper identifies significant methodological shortcomings in offline MARL research, including inconsistencies in baselines and evaluation protocols.
* The authors propose a standardized evaluation protocol, including common datasets, baselines, and evaluation methodologies, to improve the overall rigor of empirical science in offline MARL.
* The benchmarking exercise demonstrates that simple baselines can achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, outperforming proposed SOTA algorithms in most cases.
* The paper emphasizes the importance of transparency, consistency, and completeness in evaluation procedures, which is crucial for comparing and building upon prior work.

Overall, the paper provides a critical analysis of the current state of research in offline MARL, highlighting the need for standardized evaluation protocols and baselines to ensure meaningful progress in the field.
