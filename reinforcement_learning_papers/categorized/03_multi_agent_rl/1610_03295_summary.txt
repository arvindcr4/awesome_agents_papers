**PAPER:** Safe, Multi-Agent, Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
**TITLE:** Safe, Multi-Agent, Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving
**ARXIV_ID:** 1610.03295v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving, focusing on safe and efficient navigation in complex scenarios. The authors introduce a hierarchical temporal abstraction method, called an "Option Graph", to reduce the variance of the policy gradient estimator and improve the learning process.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving
* Proposal of a hierarchical temporal abstraction method, "Option Graph", to reduce variance and improve learning
* Decomposition of the policy function into a learnable part and a non-learnable part to ensure functional safety
* Experimental demonstration of the approach in a challenging double-merge scenario
