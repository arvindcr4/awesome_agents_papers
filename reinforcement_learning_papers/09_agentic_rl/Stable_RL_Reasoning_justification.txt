Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Stable Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Reasoning  Muzhi Dai♢∗, Shixuan Liu♡∗, Qingyi Si♢†, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."
- "However, such rule-based 0/1 outcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate reasoning processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe overthinking phenomena."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 09_agentic_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as agent, tool, web, matching the research direction's core themes.
