**TITLE:** MASH: Cooperative-Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Single Humanoid Robot Locomotion
**ARXIV_ID:** 2508.10423v1 [cs.RO]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). The proposed method, MASH, treats each limb (legs and arms) as an independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global critic for cooperative learning.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a novel framework that reformulates humanoid locomotion as a cooperative-heterogeneous MARL problem.
* The proposed method, MASH, enables more efficient coordination learning than conventional single-agent RL by treating each limb (arms and legs) as an independent agent with distinct action spaces.
* Experimental results show that MASH achieves superior gait execution and final performance, improves training efficiency and sample complexity, and enhances robustness in dynamic environments.
