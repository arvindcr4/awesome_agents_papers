**TITLE:** Efficient and Scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mean Field Control Games
**ARXIV_ID:** 2501.00052v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a scalable deep reinforcement learning approach to approximate equilibrium solutions to Mean Field Control Games (MFCGs) without directly solving coupled partial differential equations. The approach reformulates the MFCG problem as a Markov Decision Process and approximates both the representative agent's policy and the population distribution using standard reinforcement learning tools.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a scalable deep reinforcement learning approach to solve MFCGs
* Introduces batching and a target network to improve efficiency and scalability
* Evaluates the approach on a linear-quadratic benchmark problem and demonstrates improved performance compared to the baseline algorithm
* Explores the use of proximal policy optimization (PPO) and generalized advantage estimation (GAE) to further improve the approach
