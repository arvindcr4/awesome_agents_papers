**TITLE:** Cooperative Reward Shaping for Multi-Agent Pathfinding
**ARXIV_ID:** 2407.10403v1 [cs.AI]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning for Alignment)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel reward shaping method, Cooperative Reward Shaping (CoRS), to enhance the efficiency of multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) in distributed environments. CoRS encourages cooperation among agents by evaluating the influence of one agent on its neighbors and integrating this interaction into the reward function.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Introduces a new reward shaping method, CoRS, to promote cooperation among agents in MAPF tasks.
* Demonstrates that CoRS can improve the efficiency of MAPF in distributed environments.
* Provides a theoretical analysis of the CoRS method and its ability to induce cooperative behavior among agents.
* Evaluates the performance of CoRS in various scenarios and compares it with other state-of-the-art algorithms.
