TITLE: A ΛCDM Extension Explaining the Hubble Tension and the Spatial Curvature Ω k,0 = −0.012 ± 0.010 Measured by the Final PR4 of the Planck Mission
RESEARCH_METHOD: 02_rlhf_alignment
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper proposes a ΛCDM extension that incorporates the initial conditions of the background universe, comprising the initial energy densities and the initial post-big-bang expansion rate. The observed late-time accelerated expansion is attributed to a kinematic effect akin to a dark energy component. The authors use the Friedmann equation and the energy conservation equation to derive the evolution of the energy densities and the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the effective dark energy component. They also consider the impact of the cosmic web, particularly the formation of voids, on the expansion history of the universe.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* The authors propose a ΛCDM extension that incorporates the initial conditions of the background universe, which can explain the Hubble tension and the spatial curvature measured by the Planck mission.
* They derive the evolution of the energy densities and the EoS parameter of the effective dark energy component, which becomes time-dependent due to the impact of voids.
* The authors use the CLASS code to calculate the expansion history and power spectra of the ΛCDM extension and compare the results with the concordance ΛCDM model and observations.
* They find that the ΛCDM extension agrees well with current data, including the CMB temperature spectrum and the large-scale structure of the universe.
* The authors also discuss the implications of their model for the Hubble tension problem and the nature of dark energy.
