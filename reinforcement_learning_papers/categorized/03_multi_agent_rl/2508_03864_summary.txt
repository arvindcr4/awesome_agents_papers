**TITLE:** Evo-MARL: Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Internalized Safety
**ARXIV_ID:** 2508.03864v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** Evo-MARL is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety defenses into each task agent, eliminating reliance on external guard modules and enhancing system-level robustness. It uses a co-evolutionary mechanism that enables adversarial learning between attackers and defenders, fostering more generalizable defense strategies across agents.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety defenses into each task agent.
* Introduces a co-evolutionary training mechanism that continuously pressures agents to learn generalized defense strategies through adversarial interactions with an evolving pool of attack prompts.
* Empirically validates the method across multi-modal and text-only red team datasets, demonstrating up to 22% improvement in safety and even 5% gains in task performance.
