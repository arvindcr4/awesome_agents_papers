**TITLE**: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Shared Resources for Inventory Management
**ARXIV_ID**: 2212.07684v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: The paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to solve the inventory management problem with shared resources. The authors introduce a new framework called Shared-Resource Stochastic Game (SRSG) to model the problem and propose an algorithm called Context-aware Decentralized PPO (CD-PPO) to solve it. CD-PPO uses a decentralized training paradigm, where each agent learns independently using a local simulator, and the context of the shared resource is used to guide the learning process.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* Propose a new framework (SRSG) to model the inventory management problem with shared resources
* Introduce a new algorithm (CD-PPO) to solve the problem using a decentralized training paradigm
* Demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-PPO in solving the inventory management problem with shared resources
* Show that CD-PPO outperforms other MARL algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and performance.
