The paper "The Option Keyboard: Combining Skills in Reinforcement Learning" presents a framework for combining skills in reinforcement learning using the formalism of options. The authors argue that a robust way of combining skills is to do so directly in the goal space, using pseudo-rewards or cumulants. They propose a method for combining options using generalized policy evaluation (GPE) and generalized policy improvement (GPI), which allows for the synthesis of new options on-the-fly without additional learning.

The paper introduces the concept of an "option keyboard" (OK), which is an interface to an RL problem that provides a hierarchical representation of the environment. The OK is defined by a set of extended cumulants and a set of abstract actions, and it can be used with any RL method. The authors demonstrate the practical benefits of the OK framework in two experiments: a resource management problem and a navigation task involving a quadrupedal simulated robot.

The paper also discusses related work, including previous attempts to combine skills in the space of value functions using entropy-regularized RL. The authors compare their method to additive value composition (AVC) and show that their approach outperforms AVC in the moving-target arena experiment.

The supplementary material provides additional details on the theory and experiments, including proofs of the theoretical results, pseudo-code for the algorithms, and details of the experimental setup. It also includes additional empirical results and analysis, including a study of the effects of varying the length of the options and a comparison of the OK framework to other methods.

Overall, the paper presents a novel framework for combining skills in reinforcement learning and demonstrates its effectiveness in several experiments. The OK framework has the potential to be a powerful tool for RL, allowing agents to learn complex behaviors by combining simpler skills.
