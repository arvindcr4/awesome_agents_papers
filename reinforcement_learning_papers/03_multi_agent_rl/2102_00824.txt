ABSTRACT
Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved
significant results, most notably by leveraging the representationlearning abilities of deep neural networks. However, large centralized approaches quickly become infeasible as the number of agents
scale, and fully decentralized approaches can miss important opportunities for information sharing and coordination. Furthermore,
not all agents are equal — in some cases, individual agents may
not even have the ability to send communication to other agents
or explicitly model other agents. This paper considers the case
where there is a single, powerful, central agent that can observe
the entire observation space, and there are multiple, low-powered
local agents that can only receive local observations and are not
able to communicate with each other. The central agent’s job is
to learn what message needs to be sent to different local agents
based on the global observations, not by centrally solving the entire
problem and sending action commands, but by determining what
additional information an individual agent should receive so that
it can make a better decision. In this work we present our MARL
algorithm hammer, describe where it would be most applicable, and
implement it in the cooperative navigation and multi-agent walker
domains. Empirical results show that 1) learned communication
does indeed improve system performance, 2) results generalize to
heterogeneous local agents, and 3) results generalize to different
reward structures.

INTRODUCTION

The field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) combines
ideas from single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL), game theory, and multi-agent systems. Cooperative MARL calls for simultaneous learning and interaction of multiple agents in the same
environment to achieve shared goals. Applications like distributed
logistics [60], package delivery [42], and disaster rescue [35] are
domains that can be modeled naturally using this framework. However, even cooperative MARL suffers from several complications
inherent to multi-agent systems, including non-stationarity [3], a
potential need for coordination [3], the curse of dimensionality [44],
and global exploration [29].

Multi-agent reasoning has been extensively studied in MARL [29,
34] in both centralized and decentralized settings. While very small
systems could be completely centralized, decentralized implementation becomes indispensable as the number of agents increase,
and to cope with the exponential growth in the joint observation
and action spaces. However, it often suffers from synchronization
issues [29] and complex teammate modeling [1]. Moreover, independent learners may have to optimize their own, or the global,
reward from only local, private observations [52]. In contrast, centralized approaches can leverage global information and mitigate
non-stationarity through full awareness of all teammates.
In MARL, communication has been shown to be an important aspect, especially in tasks requiring coordination. For instance, agents
tend to locate each other or the landmarks more easily using shared
information in navigation tasks [12]. Communication can also influence the final outcomes in group strategy coordination [15, 59].
There have been significant achievements using explicit communication in video games like StarCraft II [36] as well as in mobile
robotic teams [28], smart-grid control [37], and autonomous vehicles [4]. Communication can be in the form of sharing experiences
among the agents [61], sharing low-level information like gradient
updates via communication channels [8] or sometimes directly advising appropriate actions using a pretrained agent (teacher) [54]
or even learning teachers [33, 45].
Inspired by the advantages of centralized learning and communication for synchronization we propose multi-level coordination
among intelligent agents via messages learned by a separate agent
to ease the localized learning of task-related policies. We propose
a single central agent designed to learn high-level messages based
on complete knowledge of all the local agents in the environment.
These messages are communicated to the independent learners who
are free to use or discard them while learning local policies to
achieve a set of shared goals. By introducing centralization in this
manner, the supplemental agent can play the role of a facilitator of
learning for the rest of the team. Furthermore, independent learners
need not be as powerful if they must train to communicate or model
other agents alongside learning task-specific policies.
A hierarchical approach to MARL is not new — we will contrast
with other existing methods in Section 2. However, the main insight of our algorithm is to learn to communicate relevant pieces
of information from a global perspective to help agents with limited capabilities improve their performance. Potential applications
include autonomous warehouse management [7] and traffic light

control [26], where there can be a centralized monitor. After we
introduce our algorithm, hammer, we will show results in two
very different simulated environments to showcase its versatility.
The multi-agent cooperative navigation lets agents learn in a continuous state space with discrete actions and global team rewards.
Stanford’s multi-agent walker environment has a continuous action
space and agents can receive only local rewards.
The main contributions of this paper are to explain a novel and
important setting that combines agents with different abilities and
knowledge (Section 3), introduce the hammer algorithm that addresses this setting (Section 4), and then empirically demonstrate
that hammer can make significant improvements in learning decision policies for agents (Section 6) in two multi-agent domains.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

This section will provide a summary of background concepts necessary to understand the paper and a selection of related work.

2.1

Proximal Policy Optimization

A popular choice for solving RL tasks is to use policy gradients,
where the parameters of the policy 𝜃 are directly updated to maximize an objective J(𝜃 ) by moving in the direction of ∇J(𝜃 ). In our
work, we make use of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [41],
which reduces challenges like exhibiting high variance gradient
estimates, being sensitive to the selection of step-size, progressing
slowly, or encountering catastrophic drops in performance. Moreover, it is relatively easy to implement. Its objective function, wellsuited for updates using stochastic gradient descent, can be defined
as follows: 𝐿𝐶𝐿𝐼 𝑃 (𝜃 ) = E𝑡 [𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 )𝐴𝑡 , 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝 (𝑟𝑡 (𝜃 ), 1 − 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖)𝐴𝑡 )] ,
where 𝑟𝑡 is the ratio of probability under the new and old policies,
𝐴𝑡 is the estimated advantage at time t, and 𝜖 is a hyperparameter.

2.2

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Single-agent reinforcement learning can be generalized to competitive, cooperative, or mixed multi-agent settings. We focus on
the fully cooperative multi-agent setting, which can described as
a generalization of MDPs to stochastic games (SGs). A SG for 𝑛
local agents, and an additional centralized agent in our case, can be
defined as the tuple ⟨ 𝑆, 𝑈 , 𝑂 1 , . . . , 𝑂𝑛 , 𝐴1 , . . . , 𝐴𝑛 , 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝛾 ⟩, where
𝑆 is the set of all configurations of environment states for all agents,
U is the set of all actions for the central agent, 𝑂 1, . . . , 𝑂𝑛 represent the observations of each local agent, 𝐴1, . . . , 𝐴𝑛 correspond to
the set of actions available to each local agent and 𝑃 is the state
transition function. 𝛾 is the discount factor. In case all the agents
have the same common goal (i.e., they aim to maximize the same
expected sum) the SG becomes fully cooperative.
Multi-agent state transitions are a result of the joint action of
all the agents U × 𝐴1 × · · · × 𝐴𝑛 . The policies form a joint policy
h: S × U × A. There can be two possible reward structures for
the agents. First, they could share a common team reward signal,
𝑅 : 𝑆 × 𝐴 → ℜ, defined as a function of the state s ∈ S and the
agents joint action A: 𝐴1 × ... × 𝐴𝑛 . In the case of such shared
rewards, agents aim to directly maximize the returns for the team.
Second, each agent could receive its own reward 𝑅𝑖 : 𝑂𝑖 × 𝐴𝑖 → ℜ.
A localized reward structure means that agents maximize their own
Í
individual expected discounted return r = 𝑡∞=0 𝛾 𝑡 𝑟 𝑡 .

2.3

Relevant Prior Work

Recent works in both SARL and MARL have employed deep learning methods to tackle the high dimensionality of the observation
and action spaces [10, 25, 30, 36, 51].
Several works in the past have taken advantage of hierarchical
approaches to MARL. The MAXQ algorithm was designed to provide for a hierarchical break-down of the reinforcement learning
problem by decomposing the value function for the main problem into a set of value functions for the sub-problems [6]. Tang
et al. [53] used temporal abstraction to let agents learn high-level
coordination and independent skills at different temporal scales together. Kumar et al. [18] present another framework benefiting from
temporal abstractions to achieve coordination among agents with
reduced communication complexities. These works show positive
results from combining centralized and decentralized approaches
in different manners and are therefore closely related to our work.
Vezhnevets et al. [57] introduce Feudal networks in hierarchical
reinforcement learning and employ a Manager-Worker framework.
However, there are some key differences. In their case, the manager
directly interacts with the environment to receive the team reward
and accordingly distributes it among the workers (analogous to
setting their goals), whereas in our work the central agent interacts indirectly and receives the same reward as the local agents.
Here, the central agent is only allowed to influence the actions
of independent learners rather than set their goals explicitly. One
further distinction is that they partly pretrain their workers before
introducing the manager into the scene. In contrast, our results
show that when the central agent and the independent learners
simultaneously learn, they achieve better performance.
Some works have developed architectures that use centralized
learning but ensure decentralized execution. COMA [10] used a
centralized critic to estimate the Q-function along with a counterfactual advantage for the decentralized actors in MARL. The VDN
[49] architecture trained individual agents by learning to decompose the team value functions into agent-wise value functions in a
centralized manner. QMIX [38] employs a mixing network to factor
the joint action-value into a monotonic non-linear combination of
individual value functions for each agent. Another work, MADDPG [27], extends deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) [25]
to MARL. They learn a centralized critic for each agent and continuous policies for the actors and allow explicit communication
among agents. Even though the prior research works mentioned
here address a similar setting and allow for using extra globally
accessible information like in our work, they mainly aim at decentralized execution which applies to domains where global view is
unavailable. In contrast, we target domains where a global view is
accessible to a single agent, even during execution.
There has been considerable progress in learning by communication in cooperative settings involving partially observable environments. Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable
Inter-Agent Learning (DIAL) [8] use neural networks to output
communication messages in addition to the agent’s Q-values. RIAL
used a shared network to learn a single policy whereas DIAL used
gradient sharing during learning and communication actions during execution. Both methods use discrete communication channels.

On the other hand, CommNet [48], used continuous vectors, enabled multiple communication cycles per time step and the agents
were allowed to freely enter and exit the environment. Lazaridou
et al. [21] and Mordatch et al. [32] trained the agents to develop an
emergent language for communication. Furthermore, standard techniques used in deep learning, such as dropout [47] have inspired
works where messages of other agents are dropped out during
learning to work well even in conditions with only limited communication feasible [17]. However, in all these works, the goal is to
learn inter-agent communication alongside local policies that suffer
from the bottleneck of simultaneously achieving effective communication and global collaboration [43]. They also face difficulty
in extracting essential and high-quality information for exchange
among agents [43]. Further, unlike hammer, these works expect
that more sophisticated agents are available in the environment in
terms of communication capabilities or the ability to run complex
algorithms to model other agents present.
One of the popular ways to carry out independent learning is
by emergent behaviours [23, 24, 51], where each agent learns its
own private policy and assumes all other agents to be a part of the
environment. This method disregards the underlying assumptions
of single-agent reinforcement learning, particularly the Markov
property. Although this may achieve good results [29], it can also
fail due to non-stationarity [20, 56]. Self-play can be a useful concept
in such cases [2, 46, 55], but it is still susceptible to failures through
the loss of past knowledge [19, 22, 39]. Gupta et al. [13] extend three
SARL algorithms, Deep Q Network (DQN) [31], Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG) [25], and Trust Region Policy Optimization
(TRPO) [40], to cooperative multi-agent settings.

SETTING

This section details a novel setting in which multiple agents — the
central agent and the local agents — with different capabilities and
knowledge are combined (see Figure 1). The hammer algorithm is
designed for this type of cooperative multi-agent environment.
Consider a warehouse setting where lots of small, simple, robots
fetch and stock items on shelves, as well as bring them to packing
stations. If the local agents could communicate among themselves,
they could run a distributed reasoning algorithm, but this would
require more sophisticated robots and algorithms. Or, if the observations and actions could be centralized, one very powerful agent
could determine the joint action of all the agents, but this would
not scale well and would require a very powerful agent (to address
an exponential growth in the observation and actions spaces with
the number of agents). Section 6 will make this more concrete with
two multi-agent tasks. Now, assume there is an additional central
agent in the team, that has a global perspective, unlike the local
agents, who receive only local observations. Further, the central
agent is more powerful — not only does it have access to more information, but it can also communicate messages to all local agents.
The local agents can only transmit their observations and actions
to the central agent and receive messages — local agents rely on
the communicated messages to know about other agents in the
environment. The central agent must learn to encapsulate available
information into small messages to facilitate local agents.

Figure 1: Our cooperative MARL setting: a single global
agent sends messages to help multiple independent local
agents act in an environment
Having described an overview of the setting, we can take a
closer look at the inputs, outputs, and roles of the agents in the
heterogeneous system as described in Figure 1. The centralized
agent receives a global observation 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆 on every time step and
outputs a unique message (equivalently, executes an action), 𝑢𝑖 ∈ 𝑈 ,
to each of the local agents, where 𝑖 is the agent identifier. Its global
observation s is the union of all the local observations 𝑜𝑖 ∈ 𝑂𝑖 and
actions of the independent learners 𝑎𝑖 ∈ 𝐴𝑖 — can either be obtained
from the environment or transmitted to it by the local agents at
every time step. 𝑢𝑖 encodes a message vector that a local agent
can use to make better decisions. Local agents receive a partial
observation 𝑜𝑖 , and a private message 𝑢𝑖 from the central agent.
Based on 𝑜𝑖 and 𝑢𝑖 , at each time step, all 𝑛 local agents will choose
their actions simultaneously, forming a joint action (𝐴1 × · · · × 𝐴𝑛 )
and causing a change in the environment state according to the
state transition function 𝑃.
Upon changing the dynamics of the environment, a reward 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅
— which could be team-based or localized — is sent back to the local
agents, using which they must learn how to act. If the messages
from the central agent were not useful, local agents could learn to
ignore them. Every time the central agent communicates a message
𝑢𝑖 to a local agent, it learns from the same reward as is obtained
by that local agent on performing an action 𝑎𝑖 in the environment.
In other words, the central agent does not directly interact with
the environment to get feedback, instead, it learns to output useful
messages by looking at how the independent agents performed in
the environment using the messages it communicated. In domains
with localized rewards for agents, the central agent gets a tangible
feedback for sent messages, whereas, in the case of team rewards, it
needs to learn using comparatively abstract feedback. In Section 6
we show that hammer generalizes to both the reward structures.

There are multiple local and independent agents in an environment that are given tasks. Depending on the domain, they may take
discrete or continuous actions to interact with the environment. In
hammer, we introduce a single, relatively powerful central agent
into the environment, capable of 1) obtaining a global view of all
the other agents present in an environment, and 2) transmitting
messages to them. It learns a separate policy and aims to support
the local team by communicating short messages to them. It is
designed to use both a global or local reward structure. As a result,
local agents’ private observations will now have additional messages sent to them by the central agent and they can choose to use
or discard this information while learning their policies.
As described by Algorithm 1, in every iteration, the centralized
agent receives the union of private observations of all local agents
(line 3). It encodes its input and outputs an individual message
vector for each agent (line 7). These messages from the central
agent are sent to the independent learners, augmenting their private partial observations obtained from the environment (line 9).
Then, they output an action (line 10) affecting the environment
(line 12). Reward for the joint action performed in the environment

is returned (line 12) and is utilized as feedback by all the agents to
adjust their parameters and learn private policies (lines 15—17).
There are multiple techniques for training the central agent to
learn how to communicate. One strategy could be to employ any
RL algorithm to train hammer’s central agent to learn its policy,
and use the local agents’ reward as a gradient signal. A second
strategy would be to push gradients from the local agent’s network to hammer’s central agent network, by directly connecting
the latter’s outputted communication actions to the input of the
local agent’s network. This strategy is inspired from a number of
other relevant works [9, 48]. Another strategy could be to allow
messages 𝑚𝑖 output by the central agent to first be processed by
a regularisation unit, like RU(𝑚𝑖 ) = Logistic(N (𝑚𝑖 , 𝜎)), where 𝜎 is
the standard deviation of the noise added to the channel, and then
be passed to the local agent’s network [5, 9, 14]. In Section 6, we
compare our results for all of these strategies.
The independent learners follow the formerly proposed idea of
allowing all of them to share the parameters of a single policy, hence
enabling a single policy to be learned with experiences from all the
agents simultaneously [9, 13]. This still ensures different behavior
among agents because each of them receive different observations.
Parameter sharing has been successfully applied in several other
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning settings [11, 36, 38, 48, 50].
Learning this way makes it centralized, however, execution can
be decentralized by making a copy of the policy and using them
individually in each of the agents. Furthermore, in cooperative
multi-agent settings, concurrent learning often does not scale up to
the number of agents which can make the environment dynamics
non-stationary, and difficult to learn [13]. Hence, in hammer, a
single policy is learned for the local agents via the centralized
learning, decentralized execution setting.
Note that while we focus on having a shared network for independent agents and using PPO methods for policy learning, hammer can be implemented with other MADRL algorithms. Moreover,
even though we test with a single central agent in this paper, it
is entirely possible that multiple central agents could better assist
independent learners. This is left to future works.

TASKS AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

This section details the two multi-agent environments used to evaluate hammer. In addition to releasing our code after acceptance,
we fully detail our approach so that results are replicable.

5.1

Cooperative Navigation

Cooperative navigation is one of the Multi-Agent Particle Environments [27]. It is a two-dimensional cooperative multi-agent task
with a continuous observation space and a discrete action space
consisting of 𝑛 movable agents and 𝑛 fixed landmarks. Figure 2
shows the case where 𝑛 = 3. Agents occupy physical space (i.e., are
not point masses), perform physical actions in the environment,
and have the same action and observation spaces. The agents must
learn to cover all the landmarks while avoiding collisions, without explicit communication. The global reward signal, seen by all
agents, is based on the proximity of any agent to each landmark
and the agents are penalized upon colliding with each other. The

Figure 3: Multi-Agent Walker

Figure 2: Cooperative Navigation
team reward can be defined by the equation:
𝑅 = [−

𝑁
,𝐿
∑︁

𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 (𝑎𝑛 , 𝑙))] − 𝑐,

𝑛=1,𝑙=1

where 𝑁 is the number of agents and 𝐿 is the number of landmarks
in the environment. The function dist() calculates the distance in
terms of the agents’ and landmarks’ (𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖 ) positions in the environment. The number of collisions, c, among the agents and is
set as a penalty of -1 for each time two agents collide. The action
set is discrete, corresponding to moving in the four cardinal directions or remaining motionless. Each agent’s observation includes
the relative positions of other agents and landmarks within the
frame. Note that the local observations do not convey the velocity
(movement direction) of other agents. Consistent with past work,
the initial positions of all the agents and the landmark locations
are randomized at the start of each episode, and each episode ends
after 25 time steps.
To test hammer, we modify this task so that a centralized agent
receives the union of local agents’ observations at every time step.
We also conduct relevant ablation studies on modified versions of
this environment (exhibiting graceful degradation to the system,
particularly to what the local agents can observe) to understand the
contribution of hammer’s central agent to the overall system. We
are most interested in this environment because of the motivating
robotic warehouse example.

5.2

Multi-Agent Walker

Multi-agent walker is a more complex, continuous control benchmark locomotion task [13]. A package is placed on top of 𝑛 pairs
of robot legs which can be controlled. The agents must learn to
move the package as far to the right as possible, without dropping it.
The package is large enough (it stretches across all of the walkers)
that the agents must cooperate. The environment demands high
inter-agent coordination for them to successfully navigate a complex terrain while keeping the package balanced. This environment
supports both team and individual rewards, but we focus on the
latter, to demonstrate the effectiveness of hammer in individual
feedback settings (as team rewards were already explored in the
cooperative navigation task). Each walker is given a reward of -100
if it falls and all walkers receive a reward of -100 if the package
falls. Throughout the episode, each walker is given an additional reward of +1 for every step taken. However, there is no supplemental

reward for reaching the destination. By default, the episode ends
if any walker falls, the package falls, after 500 time steps, or if the
package successfully reaches the destination. Each agent receives
32 real-valued numbers, representing information about noisy Lidar
measurements of the terrain and displacement information related
to the neighbouring agents. The action space is a 4-dimensional
continuous vector, representing the torques in the walker’s two
joints of both legs. Figure 3 is an illustration of the environment
with 𝑛 = 3 agents.
Similar to the Cooperative Navigation domain, this environment
is tweaked so that all local agents in it can transmit their private
observations to the central agent. This environment was chosen
primarily to test our approach in a continuous action domain and
in cases where individual agents receive their own local rewards
instead of global team rewards. It is also significantly more challenging than the cooperative navigation domain.

5.3

Implementation Details

In both domains, two networks were used — one for the central
agent and the second for the independent agents. PPO was used to
update the decision-making policy for the local agents. For the actor
and critic networks of these individual agents, 2 fully-connected
multi-layer perceptron layers were used to process the input layer
and to produce the output from the hidden state. Three different variants were use to train the central agent. The first variant,
hammerv1, had its own actor-critic network and learned its policy
to communicate using PPO. In this case, the central agent’s rewards
were the same as those received by the local agents from the environment. In the second variant, hammerv2, the central agent used a
multi-layer perceptron to output real-valued messages for the local
agents and learned directly via the gradients passed back to it from
the local agent network using backpropagation. In the final variant,
hammerv3, instead of directly passing the messages to the local
agent, we pre-processed the messages using a regularisation unit,
RU (as described earlier in Section 4). The central agent produces a
vector of floating points scaled to [−1, 1] and is consistent across
domains. A tanh activation function is used everywhere except for
the local agent’s output. Local agents in cooperative navigation
use a soft-max over the output, corresponding to the probability
of executing each of the five discrete actions. Local agents in the
multi-agent walker task use 4-output nodes, each of which model a
multivariate Gaussian distribution over torques.

Trials were run for 500,000 episodes in the cooperative navigation and 35,000 in the multi-agent walker environments. The
training times of baselines and hammer were similar — 12 hours
and 14 hours, respectively, for 500,000 episodes on cooperative navigation and 14 hours and 18 hours, respectively, for 35,000 episodes
in multi-agent walker. We set 𝛾 = 0.95 for all experiments. After
having tried multiple learning rates {0.01, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 3 ×
10−4, 1 × 10−2, 3 × 10−3 } and training batch sizes in PPO — we found
3 × 10−3 and 800, respectively, to work best for both the centralized
agent and the independent agents in both domains. Five independent trials with different random seeds were performed on both
environments to establish statistical significance. The clip parameter for PPO was set to 0.2. Empirically, we found that a message
length of 1 was enough to perform well in both the navigation and
multi-agent walker tasks.

RESULTS

This section describes the experiments conducted to test hammer’s
potential of encapsulating and communicating learned messages
and speeding up independent learning on the two environments —
cooperative navigation and multi-agent walker — whose details are
described in the previous section. All the curves are averaged over
five independent trials. Additional ablative studies were performed
on the modified versions of cooperative navigation environment.

6.1

Cooperative Navigation Results

We investigated in detail the learning of independent learners in
the cooperative navigation environment under different situations.
Learning curves used for evaluation are plots of the average reward
per local agent as a function of episodes. Moreover, to smooth the
curves for readability, a moving average with a window size of 1500
episodes was used for each of the cases.
At first, we let the local agents learn independently, without any
aid from other sources. The corresponding curve (red), as shown in
Figure 4, can also act as our baseline to evaluate learning curves obtained when the learners are equipped with additional messages. As
described earlier, the experimental setup is consistent with earlier
work [13].
Next, we used a central agent to learn messages, as described by
hammer, and communicated them to the local learners to see if the
learning improved. As described earlier (Section 4) hammer’s central agent is trained using more than one strategies and we compare
the results here. First, the central agent learned to communicate
by employing PPO, and used the local agents’ team-based reward
as its feedback (hammerv1). hammerv1 performed only slightly
better than independent learners alone, over a training period of
500,000 episodes, as can be seen in Figure 4 (purple). This training
strategy does provide a small amount of improvement, which could
be because of two types of problems: (Case 1) The central agent
may emit a relevant message to a local agent, but the local agent is
unable to intercept it correctly resulting in a poor reward. In such
a case, the central agent gets penalized, even though it performed
its part well. (Case 2) The central agent emits relevant messages to
some local agents, and non-relevant messages to others. In such
a case, the central agent is penalized in spite of emitting relevant
messages for some agents.

Now, to avoid the problems encountered in the previous case,
gradients from the local agent’s network were pushed to hammer’s central agent network, by directly connecting the outputted
communication vectors to the input of the local agent’s network
(hammerv2). Letting gradients flow in this manner, gives the central agent richer feedback, thus reducing the required amount of
learning by trial and error, and easing the discovery of effective
real-valued messages. Since these messages function as any other
network activation, gradients can be passed back to the central
agent’s network, allowing end-to-end backpropagation across the
entire framework. As shown in Figure 4, hammerv2 (green) performs significantly better than unaided independent learners as
well as hammerv1. However, hammer agents seem to slow after
250,000 episodes. We speculate that a larger action space (realvalued messages) causes the central agent learns to “over-encode"
the global information available to it. Having included this extra
information along with the relevant pieces would have masked the
private observations of the local agents, slowing their progress.
Finally, addressing the problem of “over-encoding" faced in the
previous case, the emitted messages were first processed by a regularisation unit — RU(𝑚𝑖 ) = Logistic(N (𝑚𝑖 , 𝜎)), to encourage discretization of the messages (by pushing the activations of the communication vectors into two different modes during training, i.e.,
where the noise is minimized), and then passed to the local agent’s
network (hammerv3). Figure 4 illustrates that hammerv3 (blue)
outperforms all the other cases. Hence, using a regularization unit
to limit the central agent’s action space was essential for learning a
better communication policy. Using a noisy channel in this manner
has been useful in other relevant works too — differentiable interagent learning [9], training document models [14] and performing
classification [5]. For our experiments, we used a value of 𝜎 = 0.2.
From these experiments, our results show that: (1) hammer
agents were able to learn much faster when compared to independent local agents, and (2) the central agent was able to successfully
learn to produce useful smaller messages. Recall that the total global
observation vector has 18×3 = 54 real-valued numbers (for 3 agents
and 3 landmarks in the environment), and our message uses only 1.
To help evaluate the communication quality, random messages
of the same length were generated and communicated to the local
agents to see if the central agent was indeed learning relevant or
useful messages. As expected, random messages induce a larger
observation space with meaningless values and degrade the performance of independent learners (Figure 4, orange curve). This also
supports the claim that the central agent is learning much better
messages to communicate (rather than sending random values) as
it outperforms the independent learning of agents provided with
random messages. Note here that the local agents are free to learn to
ignore unhelpful messages and independent agents’ learning while
receiving random messages only degrades performance slightly.
To confirm that the central agent is not simply forwarding a compressed version of the global information vector to all the agents,
we let the independent agents learn in a fully centralized manner,
using a joint observation space. The performance drops drastically
in this case (Figure 4, yellow curve). This suggests that the central
agent in hammer is learning to encapsulate only partial but relevant
information as messages and communicates them to facilitate the
learning of local agents. Complete information would have become

Figure 4: hammer agents outperform independent learners
and a centrally learned policy for independent agents. Providing the local agents with random messages causes degraded performance (as expected).
too overwhelming for the localized agents to learn how to act and
hence slowed the progress, as is clear by the curve shown in Figure
4. It has been shown previously that this approach does not perform well in domains such as pursuit, water world and multi-agent
walker [13]. We confirm the same in the cooperative navigation
environment for n=3 agents.
Ablation Studies. First, we perform an ablation experiment to
validate that hammer’s central agent is indeed facilitating independent agents’ learning and helping them coordinate by sending out
relevant messages. For this, we modify the environment preventing
agents from seeing each other. Local agents be unable to observe
other agents and would have to rely on the central agent for coordinating and covering respective landmarks. Results of hammer
in this scenario, compared to unaided independent learners, are
in Figure 5. As expected, it became difficult for the independent
learners to learn the cooperation-intensive task on their own. On
the other hand, hammer agents learned substantially better policies
faster. Note here that hammerv2 in this case performs better than
hammerv3. We speculate that this is due to local agents’ greater
dependency on central agent’s communicated messages for coordinating, and hence, hammer requiring a larger spectrum to encode
and communicate more information into its messages.
In our second ablation study, we validate whether hammer would
generalize to a setting with heterogeneous local agents. This experiment uses an environment where one of the local agents was unable
to observe other agents, while the other two agents still received
their original observations. All local agents still learn and use the
same policy, but one of them cannot see the others. As expected,
independent learners had increased difficulty in learning to coordinate (Figure 6), and were outperformed by all variants of learning
strategies for hammer. We conclude that hammer generalizes to
heterogeneous settings too.

Figure 5: This modified cooperative navigation environment
prevents the local agents from observing each other, necessitating communication. hammer’s ability to perform in this
setting shows that the central agent is indeed learning effective communication to help the local agents coordinate.

Figure 6: This version of cooperative navigation has heterogeneous local agents — one was unable to observe the other
agents, while the other two were unmodified. hammer is
again successful.
In summary, hammer successfully summarizes relevant global
knowledge into small real-valued messages to individual learners
that outperforms other cases — (1) unaided independent learning,
(2) independent agents supplied with random messages, and (3) fully
centralized training of independent agents. Specifically, hammerv3
(i.e., hammer trained by directly passing message gradients from
the local agent’s network to the central agent using backpropagation, and its messages preprocessed using a regularization unit)

Figure 7: hammer considerably improves the performance
over independent learners in the multi-agent walker task
too.
outperforms the other training strategies, learning a significantly
better policy than local agents learning independently.

Multi-Agent Walker Results

This section shows that hammer also works in a multi-agent task
with continuous control and individual rewards. Figure 7 shows
that hammerv3 agents perform considerably better than unaided
independent local agents. Like in the cooperative navigation task,
results here are averaged over five independent trials, with an
additional 5000-episode moving window to increase readability.
hammer performing better in a domain like Multi-Agent Walker
confirms the generalization of the approach to continuous action
spaces and different reward structures.∗
The results for the two test domains show that (1) heterogeneous agents successfully learn messaging and enable multi-level
coordination among the independent agents to enhance reinforcement learning using hammer approach, (2) hammer generalizes to
heterogeneous local agents in the environment, (3) the approach
works well in both discrete and continuous action spaces, and (4)
the approach performed well with both individual rewards and
global team rewards.

CONCLUSION

This paper presented hammer, an approach used to achieve multilevel coordination among heterogeneous agents by learning useful messages from a global view of the environment or the multiagent system. Using hammer, we addressed challenges like nonstationarity and inefficient coordination among agents in MARL
by introducing a powerful all-seeing central agent in addition to
the independent learners in the environment. Our results in two
domains, cooperative navigation and multi-agent walker, showed
∗ We did not include the results corresponding to the other baselines here as Gupta et

al. [13] already show that independent learners outperform a centralized policy in the
multi-agent walker domain.

that hammer can be generalized to discrete and continuous action
spaces with both global team rewards and localized personal rewards. hammer also proved to generalize to heterogeneous local
agents in the environment We believe that the key reasons for
the success of hammer were two-fold. First, we leveraged additional global information like global states, actions and rewards in
the system. Second, centralizing observations has its own benefits,
including helping to bypass problems like non-stationarity in multiagent systems and avoiding getting stuck in local optima [16, 58].
Several works, related to ours (discussed earlier) demand powerful agents in the environment — ones that can transmit to other
agents and/or are capable of modeling other agents in the system.
This might not always be feasible, thus motivating hammer, where
only one central agent needs to be powerful while the independent
learners can be simple agents interacting with the environment
based on their private local observations augmented with learned
messages. Warehouse management and traffic lights management
are two example applications that could fit these assumptions well.
There are several directions for future work from here. Both the
domains used in this work involved low-dimensional observation
spaces and seem to offer substantial global coverage on combining local observations. hammer’s results in multi-agent settings
with tighter coupling and further complex interactions involved
among agents such as in autonomous driving in SMARTS [62] or
heterogeneous multi-agent battles in StarCraft [36] could help better appreciate the significance of the method. Additionally, more
complex hierarchies could be used, such as by making several central agents available in the system. In this work, we performed an
initial analysis of message vectors communicated by hammer, but
additional work remains to better understand if and how hammer
tailors messages for the local agents using its global observation.
It would also be interesting to further study how RL learns to encode information in messages and to understand what the encoding
means. It would also be interesting to test the scalability of hammer
to a larger number of local agents in the environment. Lastly, in our
setting, communication is free — future work could consider the
case where it was costly and attempt to trade off the number of messages sent with the learning speed of hammer. If the central agent
had the ability to communicate small amounts of data occasionally,
would it still be able to provide a significant improvement?
