Abstract
The success of Deepseek-R1 has drawn the LLM community’s attention to reinforcement learning (RL) methods like GRPO. However, such rule-based 0/1
outcome reward methods lack the capability to regulate the intermediate reasoning
processes during chain-of-thought (CoT) generation, leading to severe overthinking
phenomena. In response, recent studies have designed reward functions to reinforce
models’ behaviors in producing shorter yet correct completions. Nevertheless, we
observe that these length-penalty reward functions exacerbate RL training instability: as the completion length decreases, model accuracy abruptly collapses,
often occurring early in training. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet
effective solution GRPO-λ, an efficient and stabilized variant of GRPO, which
dynamically adjusts the reward strategy by monitoring the correctness ratio among
completions within each query-sampled group. A low correctness ratio indicates
the need to avoid length penalty that compromises CoT quality, triggering a switch
to length-agnostic 0/1 rewards that prioritize reasoning capability. A high ratio
maintains length penalties to boost efficiency. Experimental results show that our
approach avoids training instability caused by length penalty while maintaining the
optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off. On the GSM8K, GPQA, MATH-500, AMC
2023, and AIME 2024 benchmarks, it improves average accuracy by 1.48% while
reducing CoT sequence length by 47.3%.

Introduction

Recent advances in large language model (LLM) community have been driven by the development
of test-time scaling [1], demonstrating a positive correlation between generation length and models’
reasoning capability, which is more effective than model-parameter scaling law [2]. The open-source
releases of DeepSeek-R1 [3] and Qwen3 [4] have further stimulated recent research on reinforcement
learning (RL) [5–9] for achieving reasoning models [10]. These models typically generate extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) [11] sequences containing rich and diverse reasoning paths.
However, recent studies [12, 13] have revealed that reasoning models often suffer from severe
overthinking [12, 14] issues, characterized by excessive shallow reasoning steps and frequent thoughtswitching in prolonged CoTs [15, 14, 16]. This occurs because the rule-based outcome rewards in
GRPO [5] cannot effectively regulate intermediate reasoning processes. While longer reasoning
chains statistically increase the probability of containing correct reasoning steps (thus improving
answer accuracy and rewards during RL training), this GRPO mechanism continuously reinforces the
lengthy CoT generation, and results in overthinking problems.
To address this issue, representative reasoning models like Kimi-1.5 [17–19] incorporate length
penalty into RL training, constraining the model to generate higher-quality reasoning within shorter
sequences, thereby mitigating overthinking while improving inference efficiency. For example, [18]
assigns the highest reward to the shortest correct completion within the group. However, as shown in
Figure 1 (left), we reveal that introducing length-aware reward or penalty functions leads to premature
RL training collapse: although CoT sequence length decreases as intended, model accuracy abruptly
plummets, preventing stable RL training for sufficient iterations.
Intuitively, reasoning models require distinct training priorities at different competency stages:
when reasoning capability is underdeveloped, reinforcement should prioritize accuracy, whereas
efficiency optimization (via length penalty) should only be introduced once the model demonstrates
sufficient reasoning capability. Current methods [19, 18] overlook this progression, indiscriminately
shortening CoT sequences for all samples during RL training, ultimately degrading the model’s
inherent reasoning capacity and causing RL training to collapse. Motivated by these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective modification to GRPO, namely GRPO-λ, that sustainably improves
reasoning efficiency without compromising reasoning accuracy, thereby preventing RL training
collapse and ensuring sufficient training iterations, as shown in Figure 1(right). Specifically, we
sample a set of completions per query following standard GRPO method, then evaluate the group-wise
correctness rate, and dynamically switches between optimization modes: applying length penalties
once correctness is adequately high (indicating mature reasoning capability to prioritize efficiency)
or defaulting to standard GRPO’s 0/1 outcome rewards (to reinforce accuracy fundamentals when
below threshold). In this way, our method enables the joint optimization of reasoning efficiency and
accuracy while ensuring training stability.
Experimental results on GSM8k [20], GPQA [21], AIME 2024 [22], AMC 2023 [23], and MATH-500
[24] benchmarks demonstrate that GRPO-λ approach achieves the dual benefit: (1) enhanced training
stability (enabling at least 2.5× more viable iterations) and (2) optimal performance-length tradeoffs,
with a remarkable 47.3% reduction in sequence length while improving accuracy by 1.48%.

Related Work

The success of OpenAI-o1 [25, 26] reveals that post-training through reinforcement learning serves
as a mainstream paradigm for unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Following
the pioneering work of Deepseek-R1 [3] and Qwen3 [4], rule-based outcome reward RL methods
[3, 17, 27–31] like GRPO [5] are widely adopted in post-training, encouraging models to produce
long CoT outputs, at the cost of inducing overthinking issues [12–14].
To solve it, recent studies [19, 18, 17] have independently proposed various length penalty mechanisms in reward function design. While these approaches share the common objective of promoting
shorter responses and penalizing longer responses among correct ones, they implement distinct
strategies. Specifically, Kimi 1.5 [12] first normalizes the length of sampled responses. For all
responses exceeding 0.5 of the normalized length threshold, it assigns negative rewards, whereas
those below receive positive rewards. Incorrect responses are restricted to a maximum reward of
0. Similarly, [18] employs a soft-clip sigmoid function to standardize and smooth length deviations

from the group distribution. This maps rewards to the interval (0,1), where shorter and correct
responses receive values closer to 1, while incorrect responses are assigned zero reward. S-GRPO
[19] adopts a dual-rollout strategy, performing early-exit interventions at different positions within
the first rollout response to construct a serial group, and allocating exponentially decaying rewards
based on positional precedence, with zero reward for incorrect ones.
Empirical observations reveal that such methods consistently induce premature collapse during RL
training. This stems from their unilateral emphasis on length penalization without assessing potential
compromises to the model’s reasoning capability. In essence, when the model demonstrates strong
pass@1 performance, length optimization should take priority for enhanced efficiency. Conversely,
when sampled responses within the group fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy (weak pass@1), the
focus should shift to reinforcing reasoning abilities rather than pursuing reasoning efficiently. Our
method GRPO-λ addresses this limitation by adaptively balancing these objectives, enabling more
stable and prolonged RL training that ultimately achieves superior performance-efficiency trade-offs.

Methods

We introduce GRPO-λ, a stabilized and efficient variant of GRPO designed to address training
instability caused by length-penalty reward. GRPO-λ uses batch-wise dynamic adjustment of reward
strategies, which selectively applies efficiency-prioritized or accuracy-prioritized optimization for
different subsets of groups within a batch. This design ensures a controlled reduction in reasoning
sequence length while maintaining accuracy, thereby preventing abrupt training collapse. Below, we
detail the components and workflow of GRPO-λ.
Query-Sampled Group Generation. For each training query Qk in the batch, the model generates
m candidate completions {Ok1 , Ok2 , . . . , Okm } using standard sampling techniques. Each completion
Oki is associated with: (1) Length Lik , indicating the number of tokens in the completion, and (2)
Outcome Reward rki , a binary 0/1 reward indicating whether Oki is correct (rki = 1) or incorrect
(rki = 0).
Batch-Wise Top-λ Selection. For each batch of queries, we evaluate the correctness of each
query-completion group and compute its correctness ratio. GRPO-λ selects the top-λ fraction of
query-completion groups in terms of correctness ratio within the batch for efficiency-prioritized
optimization. Specifically, the groups are ranked based on their correctness ratio within the batch.
The top-λ fraction (e.g., the top 20%) is selected for efficiency-prioritized optimization, as shown
in Figure 2 (Upper), as these groups demonstrate sufficient reasoning capability to focus on length
reduction. The remaining groups in the batch are assigned to accuracy-prioritized optimization to
ensure that the model continues to improve its reasoning capability.
Dynamic Reward Strategy Adjustment. Based on the batch-wise top-λ selection, GRPO-λ
applies two distinct reward strategies:

• Efficiency Priority Optimization (with Length Penalty): For the top-λ fraction of query-completion
groups (those with higher correctness ratio), a length-penalty reward is applied to encourage shorter
reasoning sequences:
(
Li −mean(Lk )correct
) if Oki is correct
1 − α · σ( k std(Lk )correct
i
(1)
rk =
0
if Oki is wrong
where α is the length penalty coefficient. mean(Lk )correct and std(Lk )correct are mean and standard
deviation of completion lengths whose answers are correct, respectively. Incorrect completions
(rki = 0) receive no reward. This strategy prioritizes reasoning efficiency for groups that already
demonstrate sufficient accuracy.
• Accuracy Priority Optimization (0/1 Outcome Reward): For the remaining groups in the batch
(those not in the top-λ subset), the reward defaults to the standard GRPO 0/1 outcome reward:

1 if Oki is correct
i
rk =
(2)
0 if Oki is wrong
This strategy ensures that the model focuses on improving reasoning accuracy for completions with
lower correctness scores.
This reward strategy prevents the imbalanced emphasis on efficiency over accuracy that can arise
from directly using length penalty for all groups [17, 32]. This ensures a controlled transition between
accuracy and efficiency priorities, effectively curbing the risk of a sharp decline in accuracy.
Advantage Computation and Parameter Update After obtaining the decaying rewards, like
GRPO, GRPO-λ calculates the advantage for each sample based on the group rewards. Specifically,
the mean and standard deviation (std) of the rewards within the group are computed, and the advantage
i)
for each sample is calculated using the formula: Âi = ri −mean(r
. Subsequently, the computed
std(ri )
advantage for each sample is broadcast to all corresponding response tokens. Finally, parameter
updates are performed based on the advantage values of each sample.

Benchmarks and Settings.

We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our method on several mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
including mathematical tasks (GSM8K [20], MATH-500 [24], and the more challenging AMC 2023
[23] and AIME 2024 [22]) as well as the scientific reasoning benchmark GPQA [21].
We choose Qwen3-8B [4] as the base model for experiments. For training data, we select queries
from DeepMath-103K [33]. Specifically, we sample 8 times for each query using Qwen3-8B, and
select queries that can be answered correctly 2-6 times. During training, we use a learning rate of
1 × 10−6 and randomly sample 16 times for each query. The generation batch size and training
batch size are both set to 128 × 16. For the length penalty, we set the scalar parameter α to 0.2. For
GRPO-λ, we set λ equal to 20%. Across all experiments, we employ Adam [34] as the standard
optimizer.

Experimental Results

As shown in Table 1, our method achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.
Compared to the conventional GRPO+length penalty approach, GRPO-λ further improves the average
accuracy by 1.48% while achieving more significant sequence length compression on five benchmarks.
Notably, For more challenging mathematical tasks (e.g., AIME 2024, AMC 2023), the benefits of our
method become even more pronounced, as the relatively simpler mathematical and scientific tasks
(e.g., GSM8K, GPQA datasets) are less sensitive to length variations.
The results of GRPO+length penalty* confirm that incorporating length penalty into the reward
function leads to training collapse. Specifically, when trained for the same number of steps as GRPOλ , GRPO+length penalty* achieves more significant sequence length compression of 89.9% but
suffers a substantial accuracy drop of 13.42%. This phenomenon should be avoided in post-training
optimization, as length compression without preserving accuracy becomes meaningless. Furthermore,
as shown in Figure 1, the accuracy of GRPO+length penalty begins to decline after 40 steps, whereas
our method maintains stable performance even at 100 steps, extending effective training steps by at
least 2.5×. This demonstrates that our approach provides stable reinforcement learning for efficient
reasoning.
Discussion.

Figure 3 presents the relationship between CoT length and accuracy for
GRPO+length penalty and GRPO-λ,
where our method’s curve consistently
occupies the Pareto-superior region
to the left and above GRPO+length
penalty’s curve. Specifically, when
GRPO+length penalty attains similar
lengths to our approach, we observe a
significant accuracy gap in our favor;
conversely, when matching our accuracy levels, GRPO+length penalty requires substantially longer reasoning
chains (e.g., ∼ 7000 vs. ∼ 5000 tokens at accuracy ≈ 0.94).

maintains robust stability in performance. Crucially, recent studies [1, 35] reveal that excessive length reduction inevitably compromises
the model’s reasoning capability. GRPO-λ adaptively optimizes sequence length within an appropriate range without sacrificing accuracy. Notably, the dense clustering of data points around the length
of 5000 suggests this represents the minimal length preserving model accuracy, which serves as a
critical threshold that our method automatically converges to.
Figure 4 presents case samples that reveal three distinct behaviors: Qwen3-8b, while generating the
longest response, provides incorrect answers due to its overthinking issue; GRPO+length penalty
successfully reduces sequence length but at the cost of impairing the model’s reasoning capability,
resulting in erroneous responses; in contrast, our method achieves correct answers while operating at
the shortest sequence length.

Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presents the first systematic study on how length-penalty reward design impacts RL
training stability in post-training and proposes GRPO-λ, a simple yet effective method. Through
extensive experiments, we reveal critical insights for balancing efficiency and accuracy. Specifically,
the CoT length reduction rate must be carefully controlled, as excessively rapid shortening inevitably

degrades accuracy. Evaluations on the GSM8K, GPQA, MATH-500, AMC 2023, and AIME 2024
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off (+1.48%
accuracy with 47.3% shorter CoT) and enhances training stability for RL of efficient reasoning.
During our experimental exploration, we made several critical observations: (1) Overly aggressive
length reduction during training causes premature reduction of reasoning paths before the model
properly adjusts them, thereby impairing the exploration of reasoning processes and ultimately hurting
accuracy. (2) The difficulty level of training data proves crucial, as oversimplified data lead to rapid
collapse of chain-of-thought length. (3) The proportion of length-penalty groups in each batch (λ
value) significantly impacts performance, where too large proportion makes accuracy difficult to
maintain. These insights will guide our comprehensive empirical study in the future version through
systematic experiments addressing all three aspects.
Beyond these findings, our methodology’s core principles suggest promising extensions. For instance,
when the model approaches a critical length reduction threshold near performance collapse, timely
intervention could be implemented by training with GRPO at a proper setting of max length for
stabilization, potentially enabling accuracy improvements while maintaining the compressed length.
