Abstract

This work proposes an extensive review of laminar and turbulent forced convective heat transfer
correlations inside tubes by analyzing both experimental and computational research. Convective
heat transfer is influenced by fluid turbulence and boundary layers, with geometry significantly
impacting flow conditions. Nusselt number correlations quantifying the heat transfer coefficient
are vital for various applications. Previous reviews are summarized regarding nanofluid heat
transfer modeling approaches in circular tubes. Additionally, comparisons of tube shapes like
circular, elliptical and flat geometries are needed. Recent database searches indicate more
experimental than numerical studies have been conducted, with greater focus on turbulent flows.
This review systematically evaluates laminar and turbulent forced heat transfer correlations
reported in the open literature, discussing both older established work as well as newer findings to
provide a holistic perspective. The goal is to better understand convective transportation
dependencies for optimized thermal design and performance improvement.

Introduction

Convection heat transfer involves the transfer of heat between a solid surface and a fluid that comes
into contact with it. Turbulence and the thickness of the boundary layer have a big impact on how
much heat is exchanged. Fluids with turbulent, or mixing, flows transfer heat much more
efficiently than laminar, or non-mixing, flows. Forced convection, where an outside source like a
pump moves the fluid, is widely used in industry because it provides excellent heat transfer
compared to natural convection from differences in temperature alone. Several fluid properties
affect the rate of heat transfer, such as density, flow rate, conductivity, and heat capacity. However,
the geometry that the fluid moves through may be the single biggest influence. The shape can
drastically change turbulence and conditions near the wall, altering how much heat is removed or
added. Understanding laminar and turbulent forced convection inside tubes is important for
predicting performance in many applications that rely on heat exchange through a tube, such as
car radiators. The Nusselt number is a common way to quantify the convection heat transfer
coefficient, and it depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent and the thermal conditions
on the surface.
Several studies have examined forced convection in circular tubes in crossflow configurations [1–
4]. Ota et al. [5] experimentally studied elliptic tubes, finding local Nusselt number varies from
circular tubes. Baughn et al.[6] experimentally evaluated single, tandem and bundled circular
cylinders under uniform heat flux, observing Nusselt number (Nu) depends on row location.
Stanescu et al. [7] experimentally optimized circular tube spacing in crossflow, following work by
Bejan et al. [8] on free convection optimizations. For instance, Khan et al. [9] experimentally
evaluated elliptical tubes with minor/major axis ratio of 0.33, finding increased heat transfer with
airflow/waterflow. Studies by Sanitjai and Goldstein [10] experimentally characterized three flow
zones around circular tubes in crossflow liquids/air. Chang and Mills [11] experimentally

evaluated circular tube aspect ratio effects, finding mean heat transfer coefficient increases with
lower aspect ratios. Tahseen et al.[12,13] and Ishak et al. [14] experimentally evaluated in-line and
staggered flat tubes, observing Nu increases with Re and heat flux. Matos et al.[15] numerically
and experimentally optimized elliptical/circular finned tubes, finding elliptical tubes increased heat
transfer up to 19% versus circular. Ibrahim and Gomaa [16] numerically and experimentally
studied elliptic bank tubes, finding best performance at small Re, attack angle, and axis ratios.
Furthermore, Tahseen et al. [16] numerically evaluated staggered/in-line flat tubes between
parallel plates, again observing increased Nusselt number with Reynolds number. Overall, these
studies provided insights into crossflow heat transfer optimization accounting for tube geometry,
configuration, flow properties and optimization parameters.
Cieśliński [17] comprehensively reviewed the studies of forced convection and nanofluids
hydrodynamics characteristics inside various tubes such as smooth circular, and straight tubes
which represent basic geometries in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. Detail correlation equations
have been proposed in order to calculate Nu and heat transfer coefficients for both laminar
/turbulent flows, including nanofluid type, nanoparticles concentration, and Re range. In addition,
several studies have simulated nanofluid heat transfer inside tubes using various modeling
approaches. Behzadmehr et al. [18] studied the turbulent forced convection applying two-phase
mixture model in a circular tube, representing the first use of this model for nanofluids. Their
results showed higher accuracy than a single-phase model and agreed with the experimental
correlation from Xuan and Li [19]. Moreover, Heris et al. [20] used a dispersion model to simulate
laminar convection in a circular tube. Moreover, studies mentioned in refs [21,22] have
investigated laminar convection using a Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. Additionally, Lotfi et al.
[23] compared a single-phase model, two-phase mixture model and two-phase Eulerian model for
nanofluids flow in a horizontal circular tube, finding the two-phase mixture model to be most
precise against experimental data. Hussein et al. [24] reviewed computational simulations and
experimental studies that have investigated using small solid particles (less than 100nm) as
additives to liquids in order to improve the low heat transfer properties and hydrodynamic flow
characteristics. The review indicated that correlation equations relating Nu, Re, concentration and
nanoparticle diameter could be developed. Further comparisons of shapes like circular, elliptical
and flat tubes are also needed to maximize heat transfer with minimal pressure penalty.

experimental studies than the numerical.

In this work, a comprehensive review of laminar and turbulent correlations of forced heat transfer
convection inside tubes is investigated. The review structure is divided into laminar and turbulent
sections. Experimental and numerical studies of laminar and turbulent forced convection flows
will be discussed and investigated. Although most of this topic studies and correlations were
investigated a long time ago, this review will mention the most recent studies as possible. The
uniqueness of this work is that it reviews the topic comprehensively for different types of topics
and applications.

Laminar forced heat transfer convection inside tubes

For laminar flow in tubes, convection can be forced or mixed. Mixed convection involves
buoyancy effects from radial density differences in the fluid. Distinguishing anong forced and
mixed convection is essential due to their associated Nu differ significantly [25]. Everts and Meyer
[26] have mapped the horizontal tubes flow regime under constant heat flux to determine if
conditions are forced or mixed. Metais and Eckert [27] similarly mapped vertical flow for constant

heat flux and surface temperature boundaries. Most heat transfer textbooks [28–31] report the fully
developed (FD) laminar Nusselt number under constant heat flux is a constant 4.36, independent
of Re or Prandtl numbers (Pr). This value assumes constant fluid properties. In case of mixed
convection situations, Nu can be 180-520% higher than 4.36 due to additional buoyancy effects
on heat transfer not considered in the theoretical 4.36 value derived for purely forced convection
[32–34]. Properly characterizing the flow regime is thus critical to predicting heat transfer
performance.
This section reviews and discusses the experimental and numerical studies that studied the laminar
forced convection correlations in detail.

2.1.

Experimental studies

Experimental studies of forced convective flow inside smooth horizontal tubes are challenging due
to the need to minimize buoyancy effects on heat transfer. One such study investigated this issue
using water, which has a Prandtl number ranging from 3.5-8.1 [35]. The test setup varied the
Reynolds number from 400 to 6000 under constant heat flux ranged from 1 to 8 kW/m2. The results
showed that at Reynolds numbers above 1000, for FD laminar forced convection, Nu is not a
constant value of 4.36 as previously derived, rather, it will vary as a function of the Re when Re
exceeded 1000. In other words, at higher Reynolds numbers of buoyancy forces can no longer be
ignored and influence heat transfer, so the classic equation giving a constant Nusselt number is
invalid in those flow conditions inside horizontal tubes. This highlights the challenges of
experimental studies in this regime due to buoyancy effects on heat transfer coefficients. The
derived correlation is:
𝑁𝑢 = 4.36 + 5.36 ∗ 10−9 𝑅𝑒 2.39
The above correlation can be used for Re of 600 and 3000 if transition does not occur (2100–2300)
[35]. As can been seen from Figure 2, the units of the experiment are fitted with the curve along
the variation of the Re.

Figure 2. A linear regression analysis of the average laminar forced convection Nu obtained from
the experiments to the corresponding Re [35].
Ghajar et al. [36] conducted an experimental test in a circular straight tube with constant heat flux
conditions. The study separated the modes of heat transfer in the laminar regime into forced and
mixed convection. Figure 3 shows the proposed setup.

Figure 3. Experimental setup diagram proposed in ref [10].
As noticed, the study observed that near the entrance of horizontal tubes, the heat transfer behavior
was ruled by pure forced convection. The reason was because secondary flows, influenced by
buoyancy, required a certain development length before impacting heat transfer. To take into
consideration the regions of entry and completely established laminar flow, the researchers
proposed a correlating equation as [36]:

The above equation is valid under the above conditions. In addition, it can be utilized to all three
inlets and is valid for both entry as well as fully developed zones' laminar driven and mixed
convection [36]. Most of the experimental studies concluded by using either theoretical models or
empirical based. However, this study is aimed to compare different correlating methods using
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This comparison will be investigated by using heat transfer
data of laminar and turbulent region that were obtained from an old single-phase heat transfer
study [36]. The below correlation predicts more data precisely compared to the traditional

A study examined heat transfer for laminar fluid flow over flat tubes placed within a channel [38].
The working fluid used was air, as at five velocities ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 m/s, corresponding to
Reynolds numbers based on hydraulic diameter between 124.5 to 622.5. The flat tube surface
received a uniform heat flux. Results from the experiment produced a correlation relating average
Nusselt number to pertinent parameters. This correlation achieved good agreement with measured
data, accurately predicting values with a minimum root mean square error of 99.70%. the
mathematical expression is stated as:
𝑚
𝑁𝑢𝐷ℎ 𝐴𝑣𝑒 = 𝐶 ∗ 𝑅𝑒𝐷ℎ

Where c and m are constant depend on the heat flux.
Another experimental study is conducted to investigate the overall heat transfer coefficients of 3
small spheres in different forced flow types, air, water, and oil [39]. As a result, the Nu number is
stated as below:
Nu = 2.0 + 1.3 (Pr)0.15 + 0.66 (Pr)0.31 (Re)0.50

This correlation is valid for:
0.4 ≤ Re ≤ 2100
0.71 ≤ Pr ≤ 380
The study validated that the heat transfer behavior for the cylindrical heating element orientation
could be accurately predicted using the given correlation developed from experimental
measurements in that flow arrangement as shown in the expression below [39]:
Nu = 0.42 (Pr)0.20 + 0.57 (Pr)0.33 (Re)0.50
Tahseen et al. [13] experimentally investigated laminar forced convection flows inside flat tubes.
Tests were conducted at five air velocities from 0.2-1.0 meter/s, corresponding to Re based on
(ReDh) of 124.5-622.5. Uniform heat fluxes of 354.9, 1016.3 and 1935.8 W/m2 were supplied at
the tube surface (see Figure 4). Results showed average Nus for the flat tube increased with
hydraulic Re at fixed heat flux. Average Nu also rose with increasing heat flux at fixed ReDh.
Additionally, they found that, as the free stream velocities increased, the friction factor decreased.
power law relationship was found between average Nu and ReDh. The derived Nuavg-ReDh
correlation accurately predicted measured data with a minimum RMSE of 99.70%.

Figure 4. The relation between heat flux and average Nu for different hydraulic Re conducted in
study Ref [13].

Conduction experimental forced convection tests in smooth circular horizontal tubes are
challenging due to the need to minimize buoyancy effects on heat transfer through use of very low
heat fluxes. Hence, a study experimentally investigated pressure drop and forced convection
performance using vertical upward and downward water flow (Prandtl 3.5-8.1) in a smooth circular
test section [25]. The experimental set up is presented in Figure 5. Experiments varied Reynolds
numbers from 400-6000 and heat fluxes from 1-8 kW/m2. While flow directions and heat fluxes
had no influence in laminar flows, the FD laminar forced convection Nu was found to vary with
Re above 1000 rather than remaining constant at 4.36. A revised laminar Nu correlation was
developed. Friction factors matched the expected fully developed laminar value of 64/Re.

Numerical studies

Nanoparticles have significant potential to enhance heat transfer in various applications. As a
result, researchers are actively studying the effects of nanoparticles and developing tailored
correlations. This study experimentally investigated forced convection heat transfer using
nanofluids inside uniformly heated tubes and between parallel discs. The nanofluids tested were
water-Al2O3 and ethylene glycol-Al2O3 mixtures [40], with nanoparticle concentration varied.
Results clearly showed the affect inclusion and concentration of nanoparticles on heat transfer.
Ethylene glycol-Al2O3 nanofluid provided greater improvement compared to the water-based
nanofluids. Correlations were derived from the experiments to compute Nusselt number as a
function of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers for the nanofluid systems.
For constant heat flux:
𝑁𝑢𝑎𝑣𝑟 = 0.086𝑅𝑒 0.55 𝑃𝑟0.5
For constant surface temperatures:
𝑁𝑢𝑎𝑣𝑟 = 0.28𝑅𝑒 0.35 𝑃𝑟0.36
Another study used CFD to analyze the convective influence of nanofluid in the tube developing
region under constat heat flux. The fluid is a mixture of water and Al2O3 [41]. The average sizes
of particles are 45 and 150 nm. In addition, the concentrations of the four particles that have been
used are 1, 2, 4 and 6 wt.%. to analyze the size influence, the study conducted at different Re that
various between (500 < Re < 2500) at different axial location of the tube. Based on simulation
outcomes, the Nusselt number equation is derived as a function of dimensionless numbers. The
results of the derived equation are complied with experimental result with a maximum error around
10%. The equation is stated as following:

𝑥 −0.37 0.293 0.6
𝑁𝑢 = 2.03𝑝𝑣0.06 ( )

Additionally, a numerical study investigated the nanofluid influence on enhancing the heat transfer
using mixture of FE3O4 and water as work fluid [42]. This study fixed the dimensions of the
channel and length. However, different geometries of cross section are investigated under different

Re numbers that varied from 500 up to 2000. In addition, the percentage of nanoparticles
concentration is between 1% and 5%. The findings showed that the nanofluid particle enhanced
the heat transfer inside the channel whatever the geometry is. Cylindrical geometry gave the
highest heat transfer value while the tringle geometry gave the lowest. However, the highest ratio
of heat transfer increment was given by the tringle geometry. a new Nu correlation equation is
developed as function of the Re number, the volumetric nanoparticle concentration and some
constants has been proposed for different geometries:
𝑁𝑢 = 𝑎 ∗ 𝑅𝑒 𝑏 + 𝑐 ∗ 𝜑
Where 𝑎, 𝑏 and 𝑐 are constants and they can be found in Table 1:

Additionally, Davarnejad et al. conducted a CFD analysis to understand the Al2O3 nanoparticles
effect on laminar convective heat transfer [43]. The results from the simulation indicated that heat
transfer was highest with greater nanoparticle concentrations. Moreover, the relation between
Peclet number and heat transfer coefficient was estimated to be directly proportional, with
increases in Peclet number correlating to higher heat transfer coefficient. The simulated data was
then validated by comparing it to experimental data from a separate study, showing good
agreement with less than 10% discrepancy. From the simulated results, a new heat transfer
correlation was derived relating Nusselt number as a function of several important parameters
including the Re that ranges between 700 and 2050, Pr, particle volume fraction, and axial
locations within the pipe defined as the horizontal distance divided by pipe diameter. The equation
is stated as following:

Moreover, Kendoush et al. conducted a study to analyze the influence of low Prandtl number fluids
on heat transfer from isothermal spherical particles [44]. Convective heat and mass transmission
over a laminar, incompressible boundary layer a stationary isothermal surface have been predicted
analytically. It was assumed in the investigation that there was an inviscid flow outside the viscous
boundary layer. The investigation of the heat and mass transfer rates at the forward and rear
stagnation points, as well as the local and total transfer rates in the front and wake zones, led to
the development of new correlations, for low Prandtl number fluids interacting with the spherical
particle surface under laminar flow conditions. Comparing the results with experimental data, the
correlation showed good results. The correlation is stated below:
𝑁𝑢 = 1.13(𝑅𝑒𝑃𝑟)0.5
A numerical 3D laminar flow and heat transfer investigation used two types of nanofluids, Al2O3
and CuO mixed with water, circulating through a flat tube representative of an automotive radiator
in ref [45]. The aim was to evaluate the nanofluids' performance relative to the base fluid. Findings
indicated the nanofluids provided good enhancement of heat transfer through the medium
compared to water alone. Additionally, the study developed a Nusselt number correlation based on
its numerical simulations to predict heat transfer for these nanofluid systems flow through the
representative radiator tube geometry.

Numerical studies of laminar forced convection producing flow in different straight canal shapes,
such as a round tube with fixed surface temperature, were carried out by Nonino et al. [46]. When
other parameters were kept constant, it was discovered that taking into consideration how viscosity
changes with temperature along the channel's length had an important effect on laminar forced
convection heat transfer coefficients. Similarly, Nouar [47] discovered that decreased viscosity
caused by increased temperature throughout the tube length affected heat transfer coefficients.
Zhai et al. [48] studied how the effects of varying fluid properties, such as axial conduction,
impacted laminar forced convection heat transfer coefficients in tubes. The researchers found that
changes in fluid characteristics had a greater influence on the velocity profile in entrance regions

of the tubes. Meanwhile, temperature profiles within the tubes were affected more significantly in
sections where the fluid flow was fully developed. So in entrance sections, velocity was more
sensitive to fluid property changes, while in fully developed regions, temperature was more
influenced by such changes, according to their findings. Overall, these studies demonstrated the
importance of considering variable fluid properties like temperature-dependent viscosity for
accurately predicting laminar forced convection heat transfer performance, particularly in
developing flow and entrance regions.

Turbulent forced heat transfer convection correlation inside tubes

This section reviews and discusses the experimental and numerical studies that studied the
turbulent forced convection correlations in detail.

3.1.

Experimental studies

Helical tubes are often used in industrial applications due to benefits like accommodating thermal
expansion, a compact design, and improved heat transfer performance. However, fluid flow within

helical tubes is more complicated than in straight tubes. This is because secondary flows are
generated in the cross-section due to the coiling, as studies have shown. The maximum velocity
shifts towards the outer wall farthest from the helical axis, resulting in asymmetric velocity and
temperature profiles across the section [51,52]. Additionally, shear stress and heat transfer
coefficients around the tube's circumferential wall become uneven. The flow field itself is
stabilized by centrifugal forces, which causes the transition from laminar to turbulent flow to be
delayed compared to straight tubes [53]. These factors associated with the curved, rotating
geometries of helical tubes complicate the internal fluid dynamics versus simple straight pipes
[53]. While centrifugal forces still influence turbulent flow in helical tubes, their dominance
decreases compared to laminar flow [54]. Several empirical friction factor correlations have been
derived from experimental regression analyses, with limited theoretical equations. For instance,
Ito [54] proposed two correlations using power law and logarithmic velocity distributions that are
widely and accurately used [55], though underestimate friction at high Reynolds numbers over
105. Zhou and Shah [56] attributed such discrepancies to neglected roughness effects at
commercially high flows. A new correlation accounting for roughness through additional
regression of tests in rough helical tubes have been developed by Zhao et al. [57], validated up to
curvature ratios of 0.063. They found roughness impacts helical flows more than straight pipes.
Despite review papers on helical convection correlations, roughness influences remain
underdiscussed despite established commercial tube significance at higher Reynolds numbers [53].
Figure 6 represents the correlations among the critical Re and the helical tube curvature ratio
calculated by several studies.

Figure 6. Critical Reynolds number correlations vs curvature ratio calculated by different studies
[54,58–60]
Aicher et al. [49] examined mixed natural and forced convection involving both upward and
downward flow in vertical tubes experimentally. The study proposed new insights that examined
the effects of varying length-to-diameter ratios and opposing or concurrent heat and mass flux
directions on heat transfer within vertically oriented tubes. Two new empirical correlations were
developed that improved upon existing models by accounting for the laminarization phenomenon
where turbulence is diminished during aiding mixed convection. Specifically, the correlations
more accurately represented the full dataset, predicting measured values from both the current
study and literature with over 80% accuracy by incorporating parameters not considered in past
equations. This captured the influence of factors like length-to-diameter ratio and directionality of
heat/mass fluxes that prior relationships did not address. A lot of research investigations in the
open literature have been tested experimenting the turbulent forced heat transfer convection flow
of nanofluid material inside tubes with a Reynold number ranging from 2300 [61–66]. Many of
them used Dittus–Boelter equation of pure water which is expressed as [24]:
𝑁𝑢 = 0.023 𝑅𝑒 0.8 𝑃𝑟0.4

Azmi et al. [67] experimentally measured heat transfer coefficients for SiO2/water and TiO2/water
nanofluids with volumes up to 3% flowing turbulently in a circular tube. Tests were run at
Reynolds numbers from 5000-25000 and a bulk temperature of 30°C. Twisted tape inserts with
twist ratios ranging from 5-93 were used inside the tube. Heat transfer enhancement was found to
decrease with greater twist ratios. At 3.0% volume, a ratio of five produced a 27.9% higher
coefficient for SiO2/water nanofluid versus water alone, but only 11.4% higher for TiO2/water
nanofluid. Correlations were developed to estimate the Nusselt number for both water and
nanofluid turbulent flow with twisted tapes, based on the test conditions. This provided predictive
equations for assessing heat transfer performance (see Figure 7).

Figure 7. Nu vs Re of nanofluid at 3% volume concentration of TiO2 and SiO2 nanofluids [67].
Pak et al. [68] conducted an experiment that investigated turbulent friction and heat transfer using
water suspended with 13nm γ-alumina and 27nm titanium dioxide nanoparticles between 1-3%
volume concentrations. Viscosity measurements significantly diverged from classical suspension
predictions. Friction factors agreed well with Kay's single-phase correlation. The Nusselt number
rose with concentration and Reynolds number, though heat transfer coefficients for 3%
concentration fluids were slightly less than water at constant velocity. Based on these findings, the
study recommended selecting larger, higher thermal conductivity particles to enhance heat transfer
performance of dispersed fluids. The study proposed a new correlation to predict turbulent
convective heat transfer for diluted dispersed fluids containing submicron metal oxide
nanoparticles. Additionally, several other experimental studies investigated nanofluid heat transfer

and pressure drop characteristics. Some studies found minimal enhancement, while others
observed higher heat transfer coefficients that increased with nanoparticle concentration but were
unaffected by changes in Reynolds number. Sonawane et al. [69] found maximum heat transfer
enhancement of 47% for 50nm Al2O3 in aviation fuel, versus 36% for 150nm particles. Abbasian
and Amani [70] examined TiO2-water and different nanoparticle sizes, finding 20nm produced
the highest Nusselt numbers and pressure drops as indicated in Figure 8. In summary, these
experimental investigations provided insight into how nanofluid thermophysical properties, heat
transfer performance and pressure characteristics are influenced by factors like base fluid,
nanoparticle material, size, concentration, and flow conditions.

Figure 8. The effect of diameter size on the Nussle number and pressure drops [70].
In another study [71], forced convection from the outer surfaces of helical coiled tubes under a
constant wall heat flux condition was experimentally analyzed. Ten tube samples with varying
diameter ratios from 7.086 to 16.142 and pitch ratios from 1.81 to 3.205 were tested in an open-

circuit wind tunnel operating in suction mode over a Reynolds number range of 6.6 × 102 to 2.3 ×
103. The results showed diameter and pitch ratios significantly impacted the average heat transfer
coefficient. At constant Reynolds and pitch ratios, average Nusselt number increased with diameter
ratio, and at constant Reynolds and diameter ratio, Nusselt number rose with pitch ratio. Based on
the experimental findings, an empirical correlation was derived relating Nusselt number to
Reynolds number, diameter ratio, and pitch ratio.
Figure 9 shows the effect of pitch ratio (P/do) on average Nusselt number, demonstrating Num
increases with both increasing Reynolds number and P/do. Specifically, at a constant Re of 1642,
Num was 37% higher for a P/do of 3.205 compared to a P/do of 1.181. Meanwhile, at constant
P/do of 2.181, Num increased 31.4% when raising Re from 660.3 to 2235. The physical mechanism
is that higher pitch ratios enhance heat transfer by raising the coil height and distances between
turns, allowing greater airflow both between coil loops and within the coil core. This leads to
augmented convection as the increased airflow amplifies heat transfer coefficient values along the
helical surface. Therefore, pitch ratio emerges as another important design factor impacting heat
transfer performance.

Numerical studies

Several reported studies have numerically simulated the turbulent forced convection inside
different type of tubes for different applications [72–75]. For instance, recently, Jedsadaratanachai
et al. [74] numerically analyzed the performance of heat transfer, pressure drop, and thermal
enhancement in a circular tube heat exchanger fitted with V-shaped orifices. The analyses
examined the effects of blockage ratio, gap spacing ratio, and orifice arrangement for turbulent
flow with Reynolds numbers of 3000-10,000. The results show that the gap spacing ratio was the
primary determinant of changes to flow and heat transfer patterns. Adjusting the gap distance
helped optimize thermal performance, especially at higher blockage ratios. Additionally, the
maximum thermal performance of the system occurred at a blockage ratio of around 2.25 for the
lowest Reynolds number of 3000 (see Figure 10).

adopted from Ref [74].

The study by Lai et al. [76] identified three pairs of vortices in turbulent curved tube flow patterns.
One pair was the typical Dean vortices. Another pair formed in the tube core due to pressure
differences. A third pair appeared near the outer wall driven by turbulence. Additionally, Ivan and
Michele [77] computationally modeled turbulent curved tube flows using various turbulence
models. Their results found excellent agreement between pressure drop predictions and
experimental data when using the SST K-ω and RMS K-ω models. However, simulations with the
standard k-omega model employing wall functions produced unsatisfactory results compared to
measured pressure drops.
Flow and heat transfer in helical tubes is more complex than straight tubes due to secondary flows
from centrifugal forces, depending on parameters like Reynolds number, curvature ratio and pitch.
Zhao et al. [53] experimentally measured friction factors in helical tubes to validate correlations.
They recommended friction factor correlations covering wide Reynolds number and curvature
ratio ranges for both laminar and turbulent regimes. For commercial heat exchangers with
Reynolds over 105, the study suggested considering roughness effects per another reference.
Additionally, new Nusselt number correlations for laminar and turbulent convection in helical
tubes were developed by regressing experimental data relating parameters that influence heat
transfer performance in helical geometries [53]. Figure 11 represent the effect of curvature ratio
on the friction factor for different Reynold number [57]. Findings presented in Figure 11 indicated
that as the roughness height increases, so too does the curvature ratio (fc,r/fstr,r). This indicates that
the impact of curvature ratio on friction factors is augmented by greater surface roughness inside
rough helical tubes. Specifically, when the tube walls become rougher as measured by increasing
roughness height, the relative effects of curvature, as represented by the variable fc,r/fstr,r, are also
increased on frictional loses. In other words, rougher inner pipe surfaces in helical tubes serve to
enhance the influence of curvature ratio changes brought on by the helical coil shape. Therefore,
the findings demonstrate that accounting for curvature ratio effects needs to be considered pipe
roughness, as rougher walls strengthen the sensitivity of friction factors to variations in tube
geometrical curvature [57].

Figure 11. The relation between curvature ratio and friction ratio with different Re numbers [57].
Mahmoudi et al. [78] experimentally and numerically analyzed forced convection and pressure
drop using TiO2/water nanofluid inside helically coiled tubes (see Figure 12). They tested
Reynolds numbers from 3000-18,000 and nanoparticle concentrations of 0.1-0.5% for five
curvature ratios. The numerical model considered thermophysical property variation with
nanofluid temperature and concentration, using the k-ε model for turbulent flow simulation.
Results showed up to a 30% increase in Nu when using nanofluid versus water. Correlations were
introduced to determine the average Nusselt number and friction factor in helically coiled tubes
under constant wall temperature for both laminar and turbulent flows. This provided insights into
physical properties effect, flow characteristics, and geometric factors on heat transfer enhancement
and pressure penalties associated with nanofluid flow in helical pipes. The aim was to provide
additional insight into geometry and property impacts on augmentation and drops.

Figure 12. Experimental set up diagram ref [78].
Figures Figure 13 (a)-(c) show how the friction factor varies along helically coiled pipes for
different Dean numbers at assorted curvature ratios. Typically, increasing Re lowers the friction
factor due to changes in the velocity profile. However, for helically coiled pipes the Dean number
primarily governs the friction factor trend, as depicted. Figures Figure 13 and Figure 14
demonstrate that at a constant curvature ratio, higher Dean numbers raise the friction factor.
Physically, stronger secondary flows develop at greater Dean numbers, intensifying momentum
transfer within the coiled pipes. Furthermore, enhanced secondary flows shift the maximum
velocity closer to the wall, steepening the wall-normal velocity gradient and increasing friction.
Therefore, the Dean number emerges as a key parameter influencing friction characteristics in
helical pipe configurations.

(b) κ = 0.0784 (coil 4), and (c) κ = 0.1231 (coil 5) [78].

number and for (a) κ = 0.05 (coil 2), (b) κ = 0.064 (coil 3), and (c) κ = 0.1778 (coil 6) [78].
Huu-Quan et al. [79] conducted CFD simulations to gain a clearer understanding of turbulent
forced convection characteristics in novel double-pipe heat exchanger featuring flat inner pipe.
Effects of variations in inner pipe geometry, specifically aspect ratio, on the flow behavior and
heat transfer were numerically analyzed. The results indicated that at lower inner pipe Reynolds
numbers below 7000, configurations with flat inner pipes possessing a small aspect ratio of 0.37
provided benefits over traditional circular pipe designs. Specifically, the flat inner pipe geometry
led to approximately 2.9% higher overall heat transfer coefficient, 2.7% increase in thermal
effectiveness, and a 16.8% boost to performance index. However, at higher Reynolds numbers
exceeding 7000, circular inner pipes were found to significantly outperform the flat pipe options.
Therefore, the study concluded that for double-pipe heat exchangers operating at lower flow
velocities, adopting flat inner pipe with a compact aspect ratio can enhance performance, while
circular pipes remain superior at higher flow rates.
Rakhsha et al. [80] numerically and experimentally investigated the flowing of CuO nanofluid
inside helical tubes under turbulent forced convection at a constat wall temperature condition. In
experiments, a heat exchanger with variable coiled tube geometries maintained a set wall

temperature. Pressure drops and temperature measurements at the inlet and outlet were used to
determine water and nanofluid Nu and friction factor. Numerical simulations employed the
OpenFOAM solver to simulate the model. Transport properties were assumed constant based on
the bulk mean temperature. Results showed an increase up to 6-7% in heat transfer and 9-10%
higher pressure drop for the nanofluid versus water numerically. Experiments reported 16-17%
enhanced heat transfer coefficients and 14-16% rise in pressure drop for different configurations
and Reynolds numbers. Both pressure drops and heat transfer increased with greater curvature
ratios and Re. Correlating equations were introduced to evaluate the friction factor and Nusselt
number based on numerical and experimental findings. This comprehensive study explored fluid
flow and heat transfer resulting from CuO nanoparticles in coiled tubes, gaining insights applicable
to efficient heat exchanger tailoring.
Bhattacharyya et al. [81] conducted CFD simulations utilizing the transition SST turbulence
model supplemented experimental analysis of forced convection in twisted tubes. This allowed
investigating flow regimes ranging from laminar to transitional to turbulent as the Reynolds
number ranged between 100 and 50,000. Simulations were conducted for a range of tube length
and pitch ratios. The predictions showed good agreement with collected measurements and
literature correlations. Analysis found that longer length ratios and smaller pitch ratios enhanced
heat transfer performance at a relatively low-pressure penalty. Notably, the twisting tube geometry
generated performance factor values exceeding unity for nearly all test conditions. This indicates
the tube twisting configuration favorably augmented heat transfer over a straight tube design.
Wu et al. [82] numerically investigated turbulent forced convection in 3D twisted elliptical tubes
with a constant surface temperature using CFD. They analyzed the effects of Reynolds number
and twist pitch on flow resistance, heat transfer, and overall thermal-hydraulic performance of
water flow. Results showed twisting motion in elliptical tubes enhanced synergy between velocity
vectors and temperature gradients, improving heat transfer versus equivalent oval tubes. While the
twisting geometry increased the encountered pressure drop due to disrupted flow, augmenting heat
transfer performance. Specifically, a tube with a diameter of 96mm demonstrated a 58-60% rise in
pressure drop but a 16-19% higher average Nusselt number relative to an oval configuration.
Furthermore, variations in Reynolds number and twist pitch influenced Nusselt number and

pressure drop trends, in addition to impacting the overall thermal performance. A twist pitch and
tube diameter of 128mm exhibited the optimal balance.

Summary of turbulent correlations

The correlations of turbulent forced heat transfer convection have been investigated for decades
externally, numerically, and theoretically for different tubes. These correlations could be for Nussle
number, Reynolds number, and friction factor. A lot of studies investigated these correlations with
nanofluid materials inside tubes for different heat exchangers and applications. Table 2 summarizes
several turbulent correlations mentioned in the open literature, the table describe the tube
geometry, correlation, study approach and some remarks.

Conclusion and remarks

This review synthesized a comprehensive overview of forced convective heat transfer tube flow
knowledge while also acknowledging ongoing needs such as developing generalized correlations
spanning broader operating ranges. Continued focus on laminar and turbulent flows as well as tube
shape impacts would further enrich available design tools. Overall, better understanding flow
turbulence, boundary layers and materials could help optimize thermal systems critical to
engineering applications. By thoroughly evaluating the extensive research basis, this study aimed
to consolidate key forced convection learning applicable across disciplines. Further advancing the
presented conclusions will contribute to progressing heat transfer science and its diverse industrial
applications. We can summarize the following findings:
•

The literature on experimental studies of heat transfer of nanofluids flowing inside tubes
is quite extensive.

•

Helical tubes are commonly examined in industrial applications, however further research
is still required.

•

Most numerical investigations have used the standard k-ε turbulence model to study
nanofluid flows yet more work is needed to advance characterization of their
thermophysical properties which heavily impact model accuracy.

•

The limited forced heat transfer correlations proposed so far exhibit narrow applicability
ranges without a generalized friction factor correlation derived for horizontal tubes.

•

Additional research should develop comprehensive hydrodynamic and heat transfer
correlations validated over broader conditions to better understand nanofluid behavior.

•

Further studies are also warranted to investigate tube geometry influences like crosssectional shape on flow characteristics within tubes and heat exchangers.

•

Preparing and testing hybrid nanofluids composed of solid particles suspended in mixed
base fluids may help optimize heat transfer for automotive cooling applications.

•

It is challenging to experimentally achieve fully developed forced convection conditions
with a constant heat flux boundary in laminar and transitional flow regimes due to
difficulties like: Tests requiring tubes to have very small diameters and small heat fluxes
to minimize buoyancy effects. This leads to high uncertainties from small temperature

changes between surface and fluid. Despite difficulties, obtaining accurate experimental
data with low uncertainties is important for fundamentally understanding internal forced
convection heat transfer.
