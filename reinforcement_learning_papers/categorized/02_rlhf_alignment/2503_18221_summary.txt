**ARXIV_ID:** 2503.18221v1 [cs.RO]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for collaborative navigation of cable-towed loads by multiple quadrupedal robots. The hierarchical robotic system combines global path planning with a decentralized MARL planner, enabling robots to make decisions based solely on local observations.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* A decentralized MARL framework for collaborative navigation of cable-towed loads by multiple quadrupedal robots.
* A hierarchical robotic system that combines global path planning with a decentralized MARL planner.
* The system is able to adapt to changes in team size, load weight, and environmental perturbations.
* Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in real-world scenarios.
* The system is able to generalize to unseen environments and adapt to new situations.
* The proposed system is scalable and can be applied to a wide range of multi-robot collaboration tasks.
