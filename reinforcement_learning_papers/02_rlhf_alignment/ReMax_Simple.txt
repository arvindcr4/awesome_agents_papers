Abstract
The asymptotic study of a time-dependent function f as the solution of a
differential equation often leads to the question of whether its derivative f˙ vanishes
at infinity. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for this is that f˙
is what may be called asymptotically uniform. We generalize the result to higher
order derivatives. We further show that the same property for f itself is also necessary and sufficient for its one-sided improper integrals to exist. On the way, the
article provides a broad study of such asymptotically uniform functions.

Introduction

When does the derivative of a function f : R+ → R tend to zero at infinity?
This certainly is the case when both f and its derivative f˙ := df /dt converge
(see Section 2). However, it has been known for a long time that this set of
hypotheses is too strong.
A similar situation occurs with (Riemann) integrals: the fact that a function is integrable does not imply that it tends to zero at infinity.
In the present work we shall address the following two questions.

Differential case: Let f : R+ → R be differentiable with limt→+∞ f (t) =
α ∈ R. Is there a necessary and sufficient condition for f˙ to converge to 0 at
infinity?
Integral Rcase: Let g : R+ → R be integrable over every interval [0, t], with
t
limt→+∞ 0 g(s)ds = α ∈ R. Does there exist a necessary and sufficient
condition for g to converge to 0 at infinity?
Since the domain of definition of all our functions will be R+ , we shall
write ∞ instead of +∞.

General discussion

Historically, the differential case seems to have received more attention. A
simple result states that, if f and f˙ converge, then the limiting value of the
latter has to be 0. This is an immediate consequence of the following lemma.
Lemma 1 Let f : R+ → R be differentiable with limt→∞ f (t) = α ∈ R.
Then, for any sequence of intervals ([an , bn ])n≥1 with an < bn , an ↑ ∞ and
inf n≥1 (bn − an ) > 0, there exists ξn ∈ (an , bn ) with limn→∞ f˙(ξn ) = 0.
Proof. For every n ≥ 1, the mean value theorem provides an < ξn < bn
with f (bn ) − f (an ) = f˙(ξn )(bn − an ). Since inf n≥1 (bn − an ) is positive, the
convergence to 0 of f (bn ) − f (an ) entails limn→∞ f˙(ξn ) = 0.

Numerous converging functions have been given whose first derivatives do
not converge [Gel-Olm, p. 40, and p. 45 for counterexamples in the integral
case].
To our knowledge, apart from Thieme, who provided a necessary and sufficient condition for the differential case [Thi, Corollary A.17], only sufficient
conditions have been given so far. The uniform continuity of f˙, respectively
of g for the integral case, is one of the best known and most frequently used
among those sufficient conditions; in control theory [Mul], the result for g is
known as Barbălat’s lemma [Bar, Far-Weg].
If one assumes continuity of g, the integral case is a consequence of the
differential case. However, in view of the existence of differentiable functions
whose derivatives are not integrable, i.e., for which the fundamental theorem
of calculus does not hold, one has to treat the two questions separately:
recall for instance the existence of differentiable functions whose derivatives
are bounded but not integrable [vRo-Sch, p. 88].
2

Already in the nineteenth century, a considerable number of mathematicians looked for sufficient conditions for the differential case. As mentioned
in [Had2], the first conditions for the vanishing of the derivative seems to be
studies by A. Kneser (1896) about the asymptotic behaviour of solutions y of
ordinary differential equations ÿ = F (t, y), when F possesses the same sign
as y [Kne, p. 182]. In his considerations on the asymptotics of a function of
the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations, Hadamard [Had1,
p. 334] appears to be the first to have stated the result independently of such
equations; his supplementary assumption is the boundedness of the second
derivative.
Theorem 1 (Hadamard’s lemma [Had1]) If the first n derivatives f (1) ,
. . . , f (n) of a function f : R+ → R are bounded, then the convergence of f to
a real number when t → ∞ implies the convergence to 0 of f (1) , . . . , f (n−1) .
Obviously unaware of [Had1], Littlewood [Lit] gave an easier proof of the
result for an arbitrarily differentiable function, which he deems “fundamental” for his study of power series. In 1913, under somewhat stronger (but, as
they stress, not necessary) conditions on f¨, Hardy and Littlewood [Har-Lit]
initiated the study of bounds on the first derivative at infinity involving f
and f¨. We give one of their results.
Theorem 2 Let g and h be positive non decreasing functions and f¨ be continuous. If f = o(g), or if g = 1 and f → α, and if f¨ = O(h), then
√
f˙ = o( gh).
In the same article, the authors extended the result to the case of several
derivatives; this led them to the following version of Hadamard’s lemma (p.
423), which merely requires the boundedness of the last derivative.
Theorem 3 If f has derivatives of all orders and if f → s at infinity, then,
if any derivative is bounded, all preceding derivatives tend to zero, or, to
state the matter in another way, if any derivative does not tend to zero, no
subsequent derivative is bounded.
A different proof of this result has been given by Coppel [Cop, p. 141] in
1965.
In 1914, Landau [Lan] originated a quantitative study of the problem
by obtaining bounds on |f | and |f¨| which guarantee that |f˙(t)| lies below a
certain value for sufficiently large t. This result led to an enormous body of

3

research, exhibited in the book [Mit-Pec-Fin], which mentions it on its very
first page.
Most results involve assumptions about f¨ for the differential case, on ġ
for the integral one. We rather look for conditions on f˙ only that solve the
differential case, resp. on g only for the integral one. As mentioned already,
a class of functions introduced by Thieme provides the solution to the differential case. We show that it solves the integral case as well. Furthermore,
we perform a detailed study of this class, and also give a more suggestive
characterization of the latter.
The next section introduces the class of asymptotically uniform functions,
the subject of this manuscript, and shows that it solves the two problems
mentioned in the Introduction. Section 4 lists and discusses properties of
these functions. Section 5 studies some sufficient and/or necessary conditions
for a function itself to vanish at infinity. In Section 6 we show that the class
of asymptotically uniform functions may also be characterized as those which
can be written as the sum of a uniformly continuous function and one which
vanishes at infinity. The last section extends the differential case to functions
with more derivatives

Asymptotically uniform functions

To our knowledge, for the integral case, the usual sufficient conditions presuppose the continuity of the integrand. However, there exist asymptotically
discontinuous functions, i.e., functions discontinuous on every unbounded interval, which simultaneously have a convergent integral and vanish at infinity,
for instance on R+ ,
(
0,
t ∈ N,
g(t) :=
−t
e , elsewhere.
On every interval [0, T ], T > 0, g is Riemann integrable, as it has only finitely
many discontinuities. As T → ∞, the integral converges to 1 and g to zero.
For a necessary and sufficient condition, we therefore include asymptotically
discontinuous functions in our considerations and introduce the following
class, which is equivalent to that proposed by Thieme. Additional examples
are provided in Section 4.
Definition 1 A function f : R+ → R will be called asymptotically uniform, (a.u.) for short, if for any ε > 0 there exist T ≥ 0 and δ > 0 such
that for all s, t ≥ T with |t − s| ≤ δ, one has |f (t) − f (s)| < ε.
4

Lemma 2 Any function f : R+ → R converging at infinity is (a.u.).
Proof. Let f : R+ → R such that limt→∞ f (t) = α ∈ R. For every ε > 0
there exists T > 0 such that |f (t) − α| < 2ε for t > T . Hence for s, t >
T, |f (t) − f (s)| ≤ |f (t) − α| + |α − f (s)| < ε independently of |t − s|. Thus
f is (a.u.).

Differential case
Theorem 4 Let f : R+ → R be differentiable with limt→∞ f (t) = α ∈ R.
Then limt→∞ f˙(t) = 0 if and only if f˙ is (a.u.).
Proof. According to Lemma 2, the convergence of f˙ in R entails its uniform
asymptoticity. Conversely, if f˙ is (a.u.), for every ε > 0 there exist T ≥ 0 and
δ > 0 such that ∀ s, t ≥ T, |t − s| ≤ δ, we have |f˙(t) − f˙(s)| < 2ε . Let tn = nδ
for n ∈ N. By the mean value theorem there exists ξn ∈ (tn , tn+1 ) such that
f (tn+1 )−f (tn )
= f˙(ξn ). Since the left-hand side converges to 0 as n → ∞, there
δ
exists N ≥ 0 such that |f˙(ξn )| < 2ε for all n ≥ N. Consequently, for every
t > max{T, tN } ∃ n∗ ≥ N such that t ∈ [tn∗ , tn∗ +1 ]; therefore, according to
the triangle inequality
|f˙(t)| ≤ |f˙(t) − f˙(ξn∗ )| + |f˙(ξn∗ )| < ε,
and thus limt→∞ f˙(t) = 0.



We can even say more when the derivative is continuous.
Theorem 5 Let f : R+ → R be differentiable with a continuous derivative
and limt→∞ f (t) = α ∈ R. Then limt→∞ f˙(t) = 0 if and only if f˙ is uniformly
continuous.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 4 and Property 5 in Section 4.



Integral case
Theorem 6 Let
R tg : R+ → R be Riemann integrable over every interval [0, t]
and let limt→∞ 0 g(s)ds = α ∈ R. Then limt→∞ g(t) = 0 if and only if g is
(a.u.).
Proof. Lemma 2 again entails the uniform asymptoticity of g if the latter converges. For the converse, let ε > 0 be given. Then there exist
T ≥ 0 and δ > 0 such that ∀ s, t ≥ T, |t − s| ≤ δ we have |g(t) −
5

R t+δ
g(s)| < 2ε . Since limt→∞ t g(s)ds = 0, there exists T ′ ≥ 0 such that
R t+δ
∀ t > T ′ , | t g(s)ds| < 2ε δ. According to the triangle inequality, for every
t > max{T, T ′ },
Z t+δ
Z t+δ
Z t+δ
ε
|g(t)|δ =
g(t)ds ≤
|g(t) − g(s)|ds +
g(s)ds < 2 δ.
2
t
t
t
Consequently, |g(t)| < ε for t > max{T, T ′ } and thus limt→∞ g(t) = 0.



As in the differential case we have the following theorem, when g is continuous.
Theorem 7 Let g : R+ → R Rbe continuous and Riemann integrable over
t
every interval [0, t]. If limt→∞ 0 g(s)ds = α ∈ R, then limt→∞ g(t) = 0 if
and only if g is uniformly continuous.
Note that the sufficient condition is the already mentioned Barbălat’s
lemma [Far-Weg].

Some properties and examples of
asymptotically uniform functions
1. The (a.u.) condition is purely asymptotic, in the sense that modifications of the function on a bounded set will not affect the validity of the
property.
2. As a direct consequence of the triangle inequality, the set of (a.u.) functions is a vector space.
3. If a sequence (fn )n≥1 of (a.u.) functions converges uniformly to f , then
f is also (a.u.). Indeed, for ε > 0, let N be such that for all n ≥ N
and t ∈ R+ , |fn (t) − f (t)| < 3ε . Since fN is (a.u.), by choosing T
sufficiently large, one can find δ > 0 such that for all s, t ≥ T, |t−s| < δ,
|fN (t) − fN (s)| < 3ε and |f (t) − f (s)| ≤ |f (t) − fN (t)| + |fN (t) − fN (s)| +
|fN (s) − f (s)| < ε.

4. Every uniformly continuous function f : R+ → R is (a.u.): the definition of asymptotic uniformity is clearly satisfied for such a function,
with T = 0. Consequently, since every Lipschitz continuous function is
uniformly continuous, it is (a.u.). Moreover, any differentiable function
f : R+ → R with a bounded derivative is (a.u.), since the mean value
theorem entails its uniform continuity.
6

5. A continuous function f : R+ → R is (a.u.) if and only if it is uniformly continuous. Indeed, for ε > 0, let T and δ be numbers provided
by the definition of asymptotic uniformity. Since f is uniformly continuous over [0, T + δ], there exists δ ∗ such that for all s, t ≤ T + δ
with |t − s| ≤ δ ∗ we have |f (t) − f (s)| < ε. The number min{δ, δ ∗ }
yields the uniform continuity over R+ . The converse is given by item 4.
This result suggests that asymptotic uniformity is mainly interesting for
asymptotically discontinuous functions. For instance, the everywhere
discontinuous function e−t IQ∩R+ (t), which obviously converges to 0 at
infinity, is (a.u.), according to Lemma 2.
6. Let f and g be two real-valued functions defined over R+ . If g is (a.u.)
and limt→∞ (f (t) − g(t)) = 0, then f is (a.u.) as well: indeed, for any
ε > 0 there exist T1 ≥ 0, δ > 0 and T2 ≥ 0 such that |g(t) − g(s)| < 3ε for
all s, t ≥ T1 , |t − s| ≤ δ and |f (t) − g(t)| < 3ε for all t ≥ T2 ; consequently,
for all s, t ≥ T = max{T1 , T2 } with |t − s| ≤ δ, we have
|f (t) − f (s)| ≤ |f (t) − g(t)| + |g(t) − g(s)| + |g(s) − f (s)| < ε.
7. Since a constant function is uniformly continuous, it is (a.u.). Property
6 with g ≡ 0 thus confirms Lemma 2.

8. Examples:

(a) The function f (t) = t is unbounded but uniformly continuous and
thus (a.u.).
(b) The function f (t) = sin(t), which obviously does not converge at
infinity, is uniformly continuous and thus (a.u.).
(c) The bounded function f (t) = sin(t2 ) is continuous but not uniformly continuous. According to property 5, it is not (a.u.).
9. An (a.u.) function is not necessarily measurable. Consider any bounded
non-measurable one, for example the indicatrix g of a non-measurable
subset of R+ . Then f (t) = e−t g(t) converges to 0 at infinity and thus is
(a.u.) according to Lemma 2, but clearly not measurable.
10. We now give a differentiable function which converges at infinity, whose
derivative is discontinuous on an unbounded sequence of points, but is
nevertheless (a.u.) as it converges to 0 at infinity (Lemma 2). Consider
the function
(
1, 0 ≤ t < 1,
f (t) :=
0, 1 ≤ t < 2,
7

periodically extended over R+ . f is discontinuous at the integers, and
bounded. Clearly, it admits a primitive, say g, which satisfies 0 ≤ ġ(t) =
f (t) ≤ 1. Choosing g(0) = 0, Rwe get 0 ≤ g(t) ≤ t. Then the
primitive
R t −s
t
−t
−t
−s
−t
of e ġ(t) is h(t) = e g(t) − 0 (−e )g(s)ds = e g(t) + 0 e g(s)ds,
and the last integrand is continuous. Since h is increasing and bounded,
it converges as t → ∞. h is our function: its derivative converges to 0
and is discontinuous at t = k, k ∈ N.

11. Contrarily to its derivative, the unbounded function f (t) = t2 is not
uniformly continuous. Our investigations led us to the following result,
which is certainly known, but that we did not find in the literature: if
f : R+ → R is bounded and differentiable with a uniformly continuous
derivative f˙, then the latter is bounded and f is uniformly continuous.
Indeed, let |f (t)| < C < ∞ for all t ∈ R+ . As f˙ is uniformly continuous,
choosing ε = 1, there exists δ > 0 such that for all 0 < h < δ and
t ≥ 0, |f˙(t + h) − f˙(t)| < 1. Furthermore, for any fixed h0 with 0 <
h0 < δ and t ≥ 0, according to the mean value theorem, there exists
ξ(t) ∈ (t, t + h0 ) such that f (t + h0 ) − f (t) = f˙(ξ(t))h0. We thus get
|f˙(ξ(t))| = | f (t+hh00)−f (t) | ≤ 2C
and for every t ∈ R+
h0
2C
.
|f˙(t)| ≤ |f˙(t) − f˙(ξ(t))| + |f˙(ξ(t))| < 1 +
h0



12. It follows from the definition that if f : R+ → R is (a.u.) and if
g : R → R is uniformly continuous, then the composite function g ◦ f is
(a.u.) as well.
13. The (a.u.) property is not preserved by almost everywhere equality. For
instance, f (t) = e−t is (a.u.) but clearly not g(t) = e−t + IN (t), despite
the fact that the two functions are equal almost everywhere.

About converging functions

Definition 2 We shall say that f : R+ → R satisfies condition (C), if
(C)

for a.e. (i.e., for almost every) t ∈ R+ , lim f (nt) = 0
n→∞

and condition (C ∗ ) if
(C ∗ )

for all t ∈ R+ , lim f (nt) = 0.
n→∞

Condition (C) is for instance satisfied for Lebesgue integrable functions,
as shown in [Les]. The following result holds for continuous functions.
8

Lemma 3 (Croft’s lemma [And-Mor-Tet, p. 17]) If f : R+ → R is
continuous and (C ∗ ) holds, then lim f (t) = 0.
t→∞

On the other hand, (C) is sufficient to provide convergence for uniformly
continuous functions. We prove the following equivalence.
Lemma 4 Let f : R+ → R be continuous and (C) hold. Then the following
two statements are equivalent:
(a) lim f (t) = 0;
t→∞

(b) f is uniformly continuous.
Proof. (a) ⇒ (b): if a continuous function converges at infinity, it is uniformly
continuous [And-Mor-Tet, p. 233].
(b) ⇒ (a): let E be the set of all t ∈ R+ for which f (nt) does not converge
to 0 as n ↑ ∞. Suppose that E 6= ∅ and let t ∈ E. By definition of the
convergence to 0, there exist ε0 > 0 and (nk )k≥1 ↑ ∞ such that
∀ k ≥ 1,

|f (nk t)| > ε0 .

According to the uniform continuity of f ,
∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ(ε) such that ∀ t, s ≥ 0, |t − s| ≤ δ(ε) ⇒ |f (t) − f (s)| < ε.
Let ε′ = ε20 . If δ(ε′ ) ∈ E c , we choose δ ′ = δ(ε′ ). Since the Lebesgue
measure of E is zero, E c is dense in R+ . If δ(ε′ ) ∈ E, it is thus always possible to choose δ ′ ∈ E c such that 0 < δ ′ < δ(ε′ ). It follows that the sequence
(f (nδ ′ ))n≥1 converges to 0 as n ↑ ∞. Therefore, there exists N ≥ 1 such that
|f (nδ ′ )| < ε′ =

∀ n ≥ N,

ε0
.
2

We partition R+ according to
R+ =

[

[nδ ′ , (n + 1)δ ′ )

n≥0

and choose nk0 > N and n′ > N such that nk0 t belongs to the interval
[n′ δ ′ , (n′ + 1)δ ′). Then
ε0 < |f (nk0 t)| ≤ |f (nk0 t) − f (n′ δ ′ )| + |f (n′ δ ′ )| < 2

ε0
= ε0 .
2

This contradiction entails E = ∅ and thus (C ∗ ) holds. f being continuous,
Lemma 3 (Croft’s lemma) completes the proof.

9

One obtains another equivalence when the continuity assumption is lifted.
Theorem 8 Let f : R+ → R be such that (C) holds. The following two
statements are equivalent:
(a) lim f (t) = 0;
t→∞

(b) f = u + r with u uniformly continuous and limt→∞ r(t) = 0.
Proof. (a) ⇒ (b) is obvious, since we can choose u(t) ≡ 0 and f = r.
(b) ⇒ (a): since (C) holds, for a.e. t > 0
lim (u(nt) + r(nt)) = 0

n→∞

and because r converges to 0, for a.e. t > 0,
lim u(nt) = 0.

n→∞

Thus (C) is also valid for u. Since the latter is uniformly continuous, Lemma
4 provides its convergence to zero at infinity, and thus that of f .

Definition 3 We shall say that f : R+ → R is a (u, r)–function if f = u+r,
with u uniformly continuous and r converging to 0 at infinity.
Remark This decomposition is obviously not unique: for instance, one
may add to u any uniformly continuous function vanishing at infinity and
subtract it from r.

Back to asymptotically uniform functions

Let N∗ denote the positive integers. In our context, a function f : R+ → R
is piecewise differentiable if there exists a strictly increasing sequence (tn )∈N∗
going to ∞ as n → ∞ such that f is required to be everywhere continuous and
differentiable only over the open intervals (tn , tn+1 ), n ∈ N∗ . The following
consequence of the mean value theorem is likely known. We nevertheless
provide a proof, which we did not find in the literature.
Lemma 5 Let f : R+ → R be piecewise differentiable with associated seS
quence (tn )n∈N∗ . If |f˙(t)| ≤ M < ∞ over n≥1 (tn , tn+1 ), then f is Lipschitz
continuous.
10

Proof. Let 0 ≤ s < t. If the interval [s, t] does not contain elements of
(tn )n∈N , the mean value theorem entails |f (t) − f (s)| ≤ M(t − s). Otherwise
there exist np ≤ nq in N∗ such that 0 ≤ s ≤ tnp < tnp +1 < ... < tnq ≤ t,
where tnp is the smallest element of the sequence (tn )n∈N∗ to the right of s
and similarly for tnq to the left of t (np = nq means that [s, t] contains only
one element tnp with 0 ≤ s ≤ tnp ≤ t) . The triangle inequality implies
|f (t) − f (s)| ≤ |f (tnp ) − f (s)| + |f (tnp +1 ) − f (tnp )| + ... + |f (t) − f (tnq )|.
Since f is continuous over each interval [tn , tn+1 ] and differentiable over
(tn , tn+1 ), the mean value theorem applies and
|f (t) − f (s)| ≤ M(tnp − s) + M(tnp +1 − tnp ) + ... + M(t − tnq ) = M(t − s).
Hence f is Lipschitz continuous with constant M.
For f : R+ → R, T ≥ 0 and ε > 0, we define VTε (f ) :=
ε, f (t) + ε).

t≥T (f (t) −

Theorem 9 For f : R+ → R, the following two statements are equivalent:
(a) f is (a.u.);

(b) ∀ ε > 0, ∃ T ≥ 0 such that VTε (f ) contains the graph of a function
defined over [T, ∞) and Lipschitz continuous there.
Proof. (a) ⇒ (b): for ε > 0, let T ≥ 0 and δ > 0 be numbers guaranteed
by the definition of the uniform asymptoticity of f for 2ε . Consider the
equispaced nodes (points at which a function is evaluated) tn = T + n 2δ for
all n ∈ N, let g(tn ) = f (tn ) and
 define g over each
 interval [tn , tn+1 ] as the
segment connecting tn , g(tn ) and tn+1 , g(tn+1 ) (g is clearly continuous
over [T, ∞)). Since tn+1 − tn = 2δ , the uniform asymptoticity of f entails
|f (t) − f (tn )| < 2ε for all t ∈ [tn , tn+1 ]. Moreover, g being affine over [tn , tn+1 ],
|f (tn )−g(t)| = |g(tn )−g(t)| = |an ||tn −t| ≤ |an ||tn −tn+1 | = |g(tn )−g(tn+1 )|,
where an is the slope of g over [tn , tn+1 ] (a point moving on a line always
drifts away from its initial vertical position). Thus |f (tn ) − g(t)| ≤ |g(tn ) −
g(tn+1 )| = |f (tn ) − f (tn+1 )| < 2ε for all t in [tn , tn+1 ]. Accordingly, for all
n ∈ N, we get
ε
|f (t) − g(t)| ≤ |f (t) − f (tn )| + |f (tn ) − g(t)| < 2 = ε
2
11

for all t in [tn , tn+1 ]. Thus |f (t) − g(t)| < ε for all t ∈ [T, ∞) and the graph
of g belongs to VTε (f ). Furthermore, the slope of g over [tn , tn+1 ] satisfies
|an | =

f (tn+1 ) − f (tn )

a bound independent of n. g being continuous over [T, ∞) and piecewise
differentiable with bounded derivative, it is Lipschitz continuous according
to Lemma 5.
(b) ⇒ (a): let T correspond to 3ε > 0 in point (b) and let g be a Lipschitz
ε

function whose graph is contained in VT3 (f ). As g is obviously uniformly
continuous, ∃ δ > 0 such that ∀ s, t ≥ T, |t − s| < δ, we have |g(t) − g(s)| < 3ε
and thus
ε
|f (t) − f (s)| ≤ |f (t) − g(t)| + |g(t) − g(s)| + |g(s) − f (s)| < 3 = ε.

Consequently, f is (a.u.).



Corollary 1 For a function f : R+ → R, the following three statements are
equivalent:
(a) f is (a.u.);
(b) There exists a uniformly continuous function u : R+ → R such that
limt→∞ (f (t) − u(t)) = 0;
(c) f is a (u, r)–function.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b): we shall construct u as a piecewise affine function, as in the
first part of the proof of Theorem 9, but with a graph contained in strips of
decreasing thickness. For ε > 0 and every k ≥ 1 we define εk = kε and denote
by uk the function corresponding to ε2k and t ≥ Tk in the first part of the proof
of Theorem 9. As we want Tk to be a node, i.e., uk−1 (Tk ) = f (Tk ) = uk (Tk ),
we choose the corresponding δk as δk−1 divided by some integer power of 2.
Furthermore, we choose Tk sufficiently large to warrant that Tk > Tk−1 + 1.
Now define the function u to be uk over [Tk , Tk+1] and u1 (T1 ) over [0, T1 ].
Clearly u is continuous and |f (t) − u(t)| < εk for t ≥ Tk ; since εk ↓ 0 as
k → ∞, we deduce that limt→∞ (f (t) − u(t)) = 0. According to property 6,
u is (a.u.). Since u is continuous, property 5 entails its uniform continuity
and we get (b).
(b) ⇒ (a): by property 4, u is (a.u.), and by property 6, f is (a.u.).
Since (b) ⇔ (c) is obvious, we have proved the equivalence of the three
statements.

α ∈ R. Then the following two assertions are equivalent:
(a) ∀ 1 ≤ k ≤ n, limt→∞ f (k) (t) = 0;
(b) f (n) is (a.u.).

Note that the case n = 1 is Theorem 4.
Proof. (a) ⇒ (b): Since limt→∞ f (n) (t) = 0, f (n) is (a.u.) by Lemma 2.
(b) ⇒ (a): We shall say that a function F defined over R+ ultimately satisfies
a property P if there exists T ≥ 0 such that F has the property P for all
t ≥ T.
To prove (a), it is sufficient to show that f (n) is ultimately bounded.
Indeed, if this is true, the already mentioned Theorem 6 in [Cop, p. 141]
provides the convergence to zero of f (k) (t), for 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, when t → ∞.
Since the derivative of f (n−1) is (a.u.) by hypothesis, the convergence of f (n)
to 0 is given by that of f (n−1) and Theorem 4.
First we note that, under the hypothesis, none of the derivatives is ultimately 0. Indeed, if one of them is 0, let i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, be the smallest index
such that f (i) is identically 0 over some interval [T, ∞). If i = 1, then f is
constant over [T, ∞) and (a) is clearly true since all subsequent derivatives
are also 0 over (T, ∞). On the other hand, under the hypothesis, the case
i ≥ 2 leads to a contradiction. Indeed, the first derivative would have to be
different from 0 asymptotically; moreover, f would be a polynomial of degree
≥ 1. In that case f could not converge in R as t → ∞. We can thus assume
that none of the derivatives is ultimately 0.
Let f : R+ → R, n ∈ N∗ , t ≥ 0, h > 0. According to Taylor’s theorem
over closed intervals [Fle, p. 168], if f (n−1) is continuous over [t, t + h] and
f (n) defined over (t, t + h), then there exists t < ξt,h < t + h such that
f (t + h) = f (t) +

Since f converges to α ∈ R when t → ∞ and f (n) is (a.u.), for every M > 0,
there exists TM ≥ 0 and 0 < δM (we can always choose δM < 1), so that
∀ t ≥ TM and 0 < h ≤ δM < 1
|f (t + h) − f (t)| <

M

and |f (n) (ξt,h ) − f (n) (t)| ≤

Thus

Hence, for every h with 0 < h ≤ δM < 1, |Rh (t)| ≤ M ∀ t ∈ [TM , ∞).
Consequently Rh is ultimately bounded, uniformly in h for 0 < h ≤ δM < 1.
Clearly, if two functions are bounded over [TM , ∞), then the same property
holds for any multiple or linear combination of them. In the spirit of Richardson extrapolation [Hil, p. 292], we shall use the two operations to successively
eliminate all the terms of Rh except the last one, which will be a bounded
multiple of f (n) ; f (n) will thus bounded over [TM , ∞) as well. We introduce
(k)
the functions fk (t) := f k!(t) and recall that none of them is ultimately 0.
From the definition we get
Rh = f1 h + f2 h2 + ... + fn hn ,

again, by the triangle inequality, |Rh | ≤ (1 + 22)(1 + 2)M. After n − 1 steps,
we get a single term, which is a multiple of f (n) , namely:

We can also adapt Hadamard’s lemma (Theorem 1) to the case when the
derivatives are uniformly continuous. This also generalizes Theorem 5.
Theorem 11 Let f : R+ → R be n-times differentiable with f (n) continuous
and assume that limt→∞ f (t) = α ∈ R. The following two statements are
equivalent:
(a) All the derivatives f (1) , . . . , f (n) converge to 0 at infinity;
(b) All the derivatives f (1) , . . . , f (n) are uniformly continuous.
We stress that the result holds for one more derivative than in Hadamard’s
lemma.
