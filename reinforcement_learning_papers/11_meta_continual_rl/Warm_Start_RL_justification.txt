Abstract Snippet:
Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Need Not Retain Offline Data Zhiyuan Zhou*1 , Andy Peng*1 , Qiyang Li1 , Sergey Levine1 , Aviral Kumar2  arXiv:2412.07762v3 [cs.LG] 2 Jul 2025  1 UC Berkeley, 2 Carnegie Mellon University  (* Equal Contribution)  The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse data, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset, followed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL fine-tuning methods require continued...
