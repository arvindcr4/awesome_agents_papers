Abstract. In this work, we show that the class of word-representable
graphs is closed under split recomposition and determine the representation number of the graph obtained by recomposing two word-representable
graphs. Accordingly, we show that the class of parity graphs is wordrepresentable. Further, we obtain a characteristic property by which the
recomposition of comparability graphs is a comparability graph. Consequently, we also establish the permutation-representation number (prn)
of the resulting comparability graph. We also introduce a subclass of
comparability graphs, called prn-irreducible graphs. We provide a criterion such that the split recomposition of two prn-irreducible graphs is a
comparability graph and determine the prn of the resultant graph.

Keywords: Word-representable graphs, representation number, prn, comparability graphs, split recomposition, prn-irreducible graph.

Introduction

A simple graph is called a word-representable graph if there is a word over its
vertices such that any two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if they
alternate in the word. The class of word-representable graphs is an interesting
class not only from graph theoretical point of view but also from algebraic and
computational view points. Sergey Kitaev and Steven Seif first studied this class
of graphs in the context of Perkin semigroups [26]. The monograph [24] introduces word-representable graphs, surveys seminal contributions, and provides
their connections to other contexts. The class of graphs which admit transitive orientations, known as comparability graphs, is an important subclass of
word-representable graphs. This class has a special feature that they can be
represented by a concatenation of permutations on their vertices, called permutationally representable graphs. In fact, the class of comparability graphs is
precisely the class of permutationally representable graphs [26]. Every comparability graph induces a poset based on one of its transitive orientations.
A word-representable graph is said to be k-word-representable if it is represented by a word in which every letter appears exactly k times. The smallest k
such that a graph is k-word-representable is said to be the representation number
of the graph. Similarly, the smallest number k such that a comparability graph

2

is represented by a concatenation of k permutations on its vertices is called the
permutation-representation number (prn) of the comparability graph. The prn
of a comparability graph is precisely the dimension of the induced poset [28].
The class of graphs with representation number at most two is characterized as
the class of circle graphs ([19]) and that with prn at most two is the class of
permutation graphs (cf. [27]). While there are no characterizations for the class
of graphs with any of these numbers more than two, it is known that the general problems of determining the representation number of a word-representable
graph, and the prn of a comparability graph are computationally hard [19,36].
The concepts of split recomposition, and its inverse operation, viz., split decomposition, were introduced by Cunningham in [8,9]. The split decomposition
can be seen as a generalization of modular decomposition introduced by Gallai in
[14]. The literature has several variants of split decomposition and recomposition,
which include 1-join composition [11]. In this paper, we use the version defined
by Bouchet [5]. These concepts have a large range of applications including NPhard optimization [30,31] and the recognition of certain classes of graphs such
as distance-hereditary graphs [15,17], circle graphs [4,13,33], and parity graphs
[6,10]. The class of distance-hereditary graphs is characterized in terms of split
components [5,20,22]. Further, it was shown in [5] that the distance-hereditary
graphs are 2-word-representable graphs. In [4], through split decomposition and
recomposition, 2-uniform words were constructed for recognizing circle graphs.
In [1], split decomposition is used to give a full enumeration of some graph classes
viz., plotemic, block, and various cactus graphs, and also to provide forbidden
subgraph characterizations of certain graph classes. The class of perfect graphs1
has both word-representable graphs as well as non-word-representable graphs
[24]. However, there is no characterization available for word-representable perfect graphs. It was shown in [2] that the class of perfect graphs is closed under
split recomposition.
In this paper, our focus is on exploring the word-representability of graphs
with respect to split recomposition. In Section 3, we show that the class of
word-representable graphs is closed under split recomposition and also determine
the representation number of the resulting graph obtained by recomposing two
word-representable graphs. Accordingly, we establish the word-representability
of a subclass of perfect graphs, known as parity graphs. The class of parity
graphs includes both bipartite graphs and distance-hereditary graphs. While
the class of comparability graphs is not closed under split recomposition, in
Section 4, we obtain a characteristic property by which the recomposition of
comparability graphs is a comparability graph. Consequently, we establish the
prn of the resulting comparability graph. In this connection, we also investigate
the prn of a graph obtained by connecting two graphs by an edge between
specified vertices. In Section 5, we introduce a subclass of comparability graphs,
which we call prn-irreducible graphs, and study their split recomposition. We
provide a criteria such that the split recomposition of two prn-irreducible graphs

A graph G is said to be a perfect graph if for every induced subgraph H of G, the
chromatic number of H is equal to the size of a largest clique in H.

3

is a comparability graph and accordingly determine the prn of the resultant
graph. We also observe that the split recomposition of prn-irreducible graphs is
not prn-irreducible.

Preliminaries

This section provides the necessary background material on word-representable
graphs, posets and split decomposition. For more details, one may refer to
[8,24,34].
A word over a finite set of letters is a finite sequence written by juxtaposing
the letters of the sequence. A subword u of a word w is a subsequence of the
sequence w, denoted by u ⪯ w. For instance, baabb ⪯ aabbaaabb. Let w be a
word over A and B be a subset of A. We write wB to denote the subword of
w that precisely consists of all occurrences of the letters of B. For example, if
w = baabdca, then w{a,b} = baaba. We say that the letters a and b alternate in
w if w{a,b} is either of the form abababa⋯ or bababab⋯ which can be of even or
odd length. A word w is called k-uniform if every letter occurs exactly k times
in w. A 1-uniform word w is a permutation on the set of letters of w. We say
a word u is a factor of a word w if w = xuy for some words x and y, possibly
empty words.
In this paper, we consider only simple (i.e., without loops or parallel edges)
and connected graphs. A graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and
E is the set of edges, is called a word-representable graph if there is a word
w with the symbols of V such that, for all a, b ∈ V , a and b are adjacent in
G if and only if a and b alternate in w. A word-representable graph G is said
to be k-word-representable if a k-uniform word represents it. It is known that
every word-representable graph is k-word-representable, for some k [25]. The
smallest number k such that a graph G is k-word-representable is called the
representation number of G, denoted by R(G).
A word-representable graph G is said to be permutationally representable if
it can be represented by a concatenation of some number of permutations on the
vertices of G. If G is represented by p1 p2 ⋯pk , where each pi is a permutation
on the vertices of G, then we say G is a permutationally k-representable graph.
The permutation-representation number (in short prn) of G, denoted by Rp (G),
is the smallest number k such that G is permutationally k-representable. It is
clear that R(G) ≤ Rp (G). Note that for the complete graph Kn on n vertices,
Rp (Kn ) = 1 = R(Kn ). The class of word-representable graphs as well as the class
of comparability graphs are hereditary with respect to the induced subgraphs (cf.
[24]). Moreover, if H is an induced subgraph of a word-representable graph G,
then R(H) ≤ R(G); further, if G is a comparability graph, then Rp (H) ≤ Rp (G).
To distinguish between two-letter words and edges of graphs, we write ab to
denote an undirected edge between vertices a and b. A directed edge from a to
Ð
→
b is denoted by ab. An orientation of a graph is an assignment of direction to
each edge so that the resulting graph is a directed graph. A vertex a of a graph
is said to be a source with respect to an orientation, if the in-degree of a is zero.

4

Similarly, if the out-degree of a is zero, then a is called a sink with respect to the
orientation. Note that a source with respect to an orientation of a graph can be
seen as a sink with respect to the orientation obtained by reversing the direction
of each edge, and vice versa. An orientation of a graph G = (V, E) is said to
Ð
→
Ð
→
→ with respect to the orientation,
be a transitive orientation if ab and bc, then Ð
ac
for all a, b, c ∈ V . If a graph admits a transitive orientation, then it is called a
comparability graph. It is known that a graph is permutationally representable
if and only if it is a comparability graph [26].
A set P with a partial order, say < on P , is called a partially ordered set or
simply a poset. Two elements a, b ∈ P are said to be comparable if a < b or b < a;
otherwise, they are called incomparable. An element a ∈ P is called a maximal
element if there is no element b ∈ P such that a < b in P . Similarly, an element
a is called minimal in P , if there is no element b such that b < a in P . For every
poset P there is a corresponding comparability graph whose vertices are the
elements of P and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are comparable
in P . Conversely, every comparability graph G induces a poset, denoted by PG ,
based on a given transitive orientation on G.
We now recall the notion of the dimension of a poset from [12] and relate it
with the prn of the corresponding comparability graph. A partial order on a set
P is said to be a linear order if any two elements are comparable. A realizer of a
poset P is a collection of linear orders {L1 , L2 , . . . , Lk } on P such that for every
a, b ∈ P , a < b in P if and only if a < b in Li , for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. The dimension
of a poset P , denoted by dim(P ), is the smallest positive integer k such that
P has a realizer of size k. It was shown in [19] that a comparability graph G
is permutationally k-representable if and only if the poset PG has dimension at
most k. Consequently, if G is a comparability graph, then Rp (G) = k if and only
if dim(PG ) = k (cf. [28]).
We use the following notations in this paper. Let G = (V, E) be a graph. The
neighborhood of a vertex a ∈ V is denoted by NG (a), and is defined by NG (a) =
{b ∈ V ∣ ab ∈ E}. For A ⊆ V , the neighborhood of A, NG (A) = ⋃a∈A NG (a) ∖ A.
Further, the subgraph of G induced by A is denoted by G[A].
We recall the concepts of split decomposition of a connected graph and its
inverse operation, viz., split recomposition. A split of a connected graph G =
(V, E) is a bipartition {V1 , V2 } of V (i.e., V = V1 ∪ V2 and V1 ∩ V2 = ∅) satisfying
the following: (i) ∣V1 ∣ ≥ 2 and ∣V2 ∣ ≥ 2, (ii) Each x ∈ NG (V1 ) is adjacent to every
y ∈ NG (V2 ). If a graph has no split, then it is said to be a prime graph.
A split decomposition of a graph G = (V, E) with split {V1 , V2 } is represented
as a disjoint union of the induced subgraphs G[V1 ] and G[V2 ] along with an edge
e = v1 v2 , where v1 and v2 are two new vertices such that v1 and v2 are adjacent
to each vertices of NG (V2 ) and NG (V1 ), respectively. By deleting the edge e, we
obtain two components with vertex sets V1 ∪ {v1 } and V2 ∪ {v2 } called the split
components. The two components are then decomposed recursively to obtain a
split decomposition of G.
Note that each split component of a graph G is isomorphic to an induced
subgraph of G [6]. A minimal split decomposition of a graph is a split decompo-

5

sition whose split components can be cliques, stars and prime graphs such that
the number of split components is minimized. While there can be multiple split
decompositions of a graph, a minimal split decomposition of a graph is unique
[8,9].
Let G = (V ∪ {m}, E) and G′ = (V ′ ∪ {m′ }, E ′ ) be two graphs with disjoint
vertex sets. Then the split recomposition of G and G′ with respect to the vertices
m and m′ , called the marked vertices, is denoted by G m ⍟m′ G′ , and defined by
G m ⍟m′ G′ = (V ′′ , E ′′ ), where the vertex set V ′′ = V ∪V ′ and edge set E ′′ contains
edges of G[V ], edges of G′ [V ′ ] and {ab ∣ a ∈ NG (m), b ∈ NG′ (m′ )}.
Remark 1. Let G = (V ∪ {m}, E) and G′ = (V ′ ∪ {m′ }, E ′ ) be two graphs. Then
G and G′ are induced subgraphs of G m ⍟m′ G′ . For instance, if b ∈ NG (m)
and b′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ), then (G m ⍟m′ G′ )[V ∪ {b′ }] is isomorphic to G, and G′ is
isomorphic to (G m ⍟m′ G′ )[V ′ ∪ {b}].

Word-Representable Graphs

As stated in the following remark, while word-representability is preserved by
split decomposition, in this section, we show that split recomposition also preserves the word-representability of graphs. Consequently, we observe that the
class of parity graphs is word-representable. We also relate the representation
number of the graph obtained by the recomposition with its components.
Remark 2. If a graph G is word-representable, then its split components are
word-representable, as they are induced subgraphs of G.
Theorem 1. If G = (V ∪ {m}, E) and G′ = (V ′ ∪ {m′ }, E ′ ) are two k-wordrepresentable graphs, then so is the split recomposition G m ⍟m′ G′ .
Proof. Let w and w′ be two k-uniform words representing the graphs G and G′ ,
respectively. In view of [25, Proposition 5], note that a cyclic shift of a k-uniform
word representing a graph also represents the graph. Accordingly, assume w =
w1 mw2 m⋯wk m and w′ = m′ w1′ m′ w2′ ⋯m′ wk′ . Note that wV = w1 w2 ⋯wk and
wV′ ′ = w1′ w2′ ⋯wk′ . Moreover, wV and wV′ ′ are k-uniform words. We will show
that the k-uniform word u = w1 w1′ w2 w2′ ⋯wk wk′ represents the graph G m ⍟m′ G′ .
Note that the induced subgraphs G[V ] and G′ [V ′ ] are induced subgraphs
of G m ⍟m′ G′ . Further, the k-uniform words wV and wV′ ′ represent G[V ] and
G′ [V ′ ], respectively. Accordingly, since uV = wV and uV ′ = wV′ ′ , any two vertices
of G[V ] or of G′ [V ′ ] are adjacent if and only if they alternate in the word u.
For a ∈ V and b ∈ V ′ , note that a and b are adjacent in G m ⍟m′ G′ if and only
if a ∈ NG (m) and b ∈ NG′ (m′ ). Accordingly, we consider the following cases to
complete the proof.
k

Let a ∈ NG (m) and b ∈ NG′ (m′ ). Note that w{a,m} = am ⋯ am (i.e., the word
k

′
′
′
obtained by concatenating am for k times) and w{b,m
′ } = m b ⋯ m b. Accordingly,

6

for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, wi and wi′ contain exactly one copy of a and b, respectively.
k

Hence, u{a,b} = ab ⋯ ab so that a and b alternate in u.
Let a ∉ NG (m). Since the k-uniform word w represents G, the vertices a and
m do not alternate in w. Hence, aa is a substring of wt , for some t. For any
b ∈ V ′ , note that b does not appear in wt . According to the construction of u, the
subword u{a,b} has aa as a factor. Hence, a and b do not alternate in u. Similarly,
when b ∉ NG′ (m′ ), we can observe that b does not alternate with any a ∈ V .
⊔
⊓
Hence, the k-uniform word u represents G m ⍟m′ G′ .
Corollary 1. If G = (V ∪ {m}, E) and G′ = (V ′ ∪ {m′ }, E ′ ) are two wordrepresentable graphs such that R(G) = k and R(G′ ) = k ′ , then R(G m ⍟m′ G′ ) =
max{k, k ′ }.
Proof. Let t = max{k, k ′ }. Using [25, Observation 4], both G and G′ are t-wordrepresentable. Consequently, by Theorem 1, G m ⍟m′ G′ is t-word-representable
so that R(G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≤ t. But, by Remark 1, since G and G′ are isomorphic
to certain induced subgraphs of G m ⍟m′ G′ , we have R(G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≥ t. Hence,
⊔
⊓
R(G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ }.
We now summarize the characterization of word-representability of a graph
with respect to its split decomposition in the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Let Hi (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the components of a split decomposition of
a graph G. Then G is word-representable if and only if Hi is word-representable
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ s. Further, R(G) = max R(Hi ).
1≤i≤s

In view of the fact that the class of perfect graphs is closed under split
recomposition [2], we have the following corollary of Theorem 2. Although a
characterization for word-representable perfect graphs is an open problem, this
corollary may be useful in this regard.
Corollary 2. A perfect graph is not word-representable if and only if at least
one of its prime components is a non-word-representable perfect graph.
Thus, the class of prime perfect graphs that are not word-representable completely determines the class of perfect graphs that are not word-representable.
A graph is called a parity graph if the lengths of any two induced paths
between a pair of vertices are of the same parity. The class of parity graphs is a
subclass of perfect graphs [32]. Recall from [6] that a graph G is a parity graph
if and only if every component in its minimal split decomposition is a clique
or a bipartite graph. Accordingly, since cliques and bipartite graphs are wordrepresentable, we have the following corollary of Theorem 2. Thus, we establish a
class of word-representable graphs within perfect graphs which includes bipartite
graphs as well as distance-hereditary graphs.
Corollary 3. The class of parity graphs is word-representable.

Comparability Graphs

In this section, we study the recomposition of comparability graphs. First we
observe that the class of comparability graphs is not closed under split recomposition. In Subsection 4.1, we give a sufficient condition so that a recomposition
is a comparability graph. Further, in Subsection 4.2, we investigate the prn of
a recomposition of comparability graphs. Finally, in Subsection 4.3, we provide
a characteristic property by which a recomposition of comparability graphs is a
comparability graph.
Let G be a comparability graph. Note that every split component of G is a
comparability graph, as it is (isomorphic) an induced subgraph of G. However, as
shown in the following example, split recomposition of two comparability graphs
is not always a comparability graph.
Example 1. The graphs G and G′ shown in Fig. 1 are comparability graphs.
However, the split recomposition G m ⍟m′ G′ is not a comparability graph (cf.
[18, Chapter 5]).

Fig. 1. Recomposition of two comparability graphs

For the rest of the paper, let G = (V ∪ {m}, E) and G′ = (V ′ ∪ {m′ }, E ′ ) be
two graphs with disjoint vertex sets. Consider the graph
H = (V ∪ V ′ ∪ {m, m′ }, E ∪ E ′ ∪ {mm′ }),
which is obtained by adding the edge mm′ between G and G′ . This graph operation is useful in the sequel for investigating a sufficient condition and the prn
of G m ⍟m′ G′ .
4.1

Sufficient Condition

In this subsection, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for H to be a
comparability graph. Further, we also discuss the conditions under which the
recomposition G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph. As a consequence, we also
establish that a recomposition of bipartite graphs is a bipartite graph.

8

Theorem 3. The graph H is a comparability graph if and only if there exist
transitive orientations T and T ′ of G and G′ , respectively, such that m is a
source of T and m′ is a sink of T ′ , or vice versa.
Proof. Suppose T and T ′ are transitive orientations of G and G′ , respectively,
′
′
such that m is a source of T and m′ is a sink of TÐ
.ÐWe
→ extend T and T to an
orientation TH of H by orienting the edge mm′ as mm′ . In case, if m is a sink of
ÐÐ→
T and m′ is a source of T ′ , then assign m′ m as the orientation to the edge mm′
in TH . In both the cases, clearly, TH is a transitive orientation of H so that H
is a comparability graph.
Conversely, suppose H is a comparability graph. Let TH be a transitive oriÐÐ→
entation of H in which the edge mm′ is oriented as mm′ . We claim that m is
a source and m′ is a sink with respect to TH . On the contrary, we have the
following cases:
→ in T . By transitivity
– m is not a source: Then, for some a ∈ V , we have Ð
am
H
ÐÐ→′
′
of TH , am exists in TH ; which is a contradiction as am is not an edge in
H.
Ð→
– m′ is not a sink: Then, for some b ∈ V ′ , we have m′ b in TH . By transitivity
Ð→
of TH , mb exists in TH ; which is a contradiction as mb is not an edge in H.
This proves our claim. Note that H[V ∪{m}] = G and H[V ′ ∪{m′ }] = G′ . Further,
let T and T ′ be the restrictions of TH to G and G′ , respectively. Clearly, T and
T ′ are transitive orientations of G and G′ , respectively. Moreover, m is a source
of T and m′ is a sink of T ′ .
ÐÐ→
Similarly, if the edge mm′ of H is oriented as m′ m in TH , then we can show
that there exist transitive orientations T and T ′ of G and G′ , respectively, such
that m is a sink of T and m′ is a source of T ′ .
⊔
⊓
We now present a condition under which a recomposition of comparability
graphs is a comparability graph.
Theorem 4. If G and G′ are comparability graphs such that m is a source of
G and m′ is a sink of G′ with respect to some transitive orientations of G and
G′ , then G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph.
Proof. By Theorem 3, H is a comparability graph in which m is a source and
m′ is a sink. In view of the discussion in [7, Section 3], we give a transitive
orientation to G m ⍟m′ G′ from a transitive orientation of H by deleting m and
Ð
→
m′ and by orienting ba for all adjacent vertices a(≠ m′ ) of m and b(≠ m) of
m′ .
⊔
⊓
Remark 3. In Theorem 4, if m is a sink and m′ is a source with respect to some
transitive orientations of G and G′ , respectively, then also a transitive orientation
can be assigned to G m ⍟m′ G′ . Hence, in the rest of the paper, we consider one
of the combinations to state the corresponding results.

9

Since every bipartite graph is a comparability graph, we have the following
corollary.
Corollary 4. If G and G′ are two bipartite graphs, then for any choice of vertices m and m′ , the split recomposition G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph.
Proof. Let {A, B} be a bipartition of G and {A′ , B ′ } be a bipartition of G′ .
Without loss of generality, suppose m ∈ A and m′ ∈ A′ . Assign orientation to the
Ð→
Ð
→
edges in E as ab such that a ∈ A, b ∈ B and the edges in E ′ as b′ a′ such that
b′ ∈ B ′ , a′ ∈ A′ . In this transitive orientation, m is a source and m′ is a sink.
Hence, the result follows from Theorem 4.
⊔
⊓
Moreover, we have the following result for bipartite graphs.
Proposition 1. If G and G′ are two bipartite graphs, then for any choice of
vertices m and m′ , the split recomposition G m ⍟m′ G′ is a bipartite graph.
Proof. Let {A, B} be a bipartition of G and {A′ , B ′ } be a bipartition of G′ .
Without loss of generality, suppose m ∈ A and m′ ∈ A′ . We prove that {(A ∖
{m})∪B ′, (A′ ∖{m′ })∪B} is a bipartition of the vertices of G m ⍟m′ G′ . Consider
an edge ab of G m ⍟m′ G′ . Then ab is in one of the induced subgraphs G[V ] and
G′ [V ′ ], or it is an edge between NG (m) and NG′ (m′ ). In any case, it can be
observed that if a ∈ (A ∖ {m}) ∪ B ′ then b ∈ (A′ ∖ {m′ }) ∪ B, or vice versa.

4.2

Permutation-Representation Number

In this subsection, we study the prn of the graph H and obtain a partial result
on the prn of G m ⍟m′ G′ . A complete result on the prn of G m ⍟m′ G′ is given in
Subsection 4.3, subsequent to its characterization.
Lemma 1. Let G be a comparability graph with a transitive orientation T . If m
is a source with respect to T , then m is a minimal element of the induced poset
PG . Similarly, if m is a sink, then m is a maximal element of PG .
Proof. Let us assume that m is not a minimal element of PG . Then there exists
→ in G with
a in PG such that a < m in PG which implies there is an edge Ð
am
respect to T . This is a contradiction to m is a source. Similarly, the result can
be proved when m is a sink.
⊔
⊓
The following remark produces a word to represent a comparability graph
based on a realizer of its induced poset.
Remark 4. Let C be a comparability graph and PC be the poset induced by a
transitive orientation of C. Let {L1 , L2 , . . . , Lk } be a realizer of PC . For 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
construct permutations pi from Li on the vertices of C such that a occurs before
b in the permutation pi if a < b in Li . Then, in view of [19, Lemma 4], the word
p1 p2 ⋯pk represents C.

10

Proposition 2. Let G be a comparability graph such that m is a source (or
sink) with respect to some transitive orientation of G. Then there exist k and
permutations pi on V , for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, which can be extended to permutations qi
on V ∪ {m}, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1, such that p1 ⋯pk represents G[V ] and q1 ⋯qk qk+1
represents G.
Proof. Consider the poset PG induced by the transitive orientation of G for
which m is a source. Note that m is a minimal element of PG . Now consider
the subposet of PG with the elements of V and note that the corresponding
comparability graph is G[V ]. Accordingly, we denote the subposet by PG[V ] .
Consider a realizer L = {L1 , L2 , . . . , Lk } of PG[V ] . Using the construction in
[21, Theorem 4.2] (see also [34, Theorem 9.3 in Chapter 1] and [3, Theorem
2.11]), we extend L to a realizer M = {M1 , M2 , . . . , Mk , Mk+1 } of PG as per the
following: Let U (m) = {a ∈ V ∣ a > m in PG } and set
Mi = m < Li , (1 ≤ i ≤ k);
Mk+1 = Lk (V ∖ U (m)) < m < Lk (U (m)),
where, for X ⊆ V , Lk (X) is the linear order on X obtained from Lk by restricting
it to X.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, construct permutations pi from Li such that a occurs before
b in pi if a < b in Li . Similarly, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1, construct permutations qi
from Mi . Note that, as m is a minimal element of PG , we have NG (m) = U (m).
Accordingly, note that
qi = mpi ,

(1 ≤ i ≤ k);

qk+1 = pkV ∖NG (m) mpkNG (m) .
Hence, by Remark 4, the words p1 p2 ⋯pk and q1 q2 ⋯qk qk+1 represent the graphs
G[V ] and G, respectively.
Similarly, if m is a sink, there exist permutations pi on V , for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and
permutations qi on V ∪ {m}, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1, such that the words p1 p2 ⋯pk and
q1 q2 ⋯qk qk+1 represent G[V ] and G, respectively, where the permutations qi are

Note that Rp (G) = k implies dim(PG ) = k so that dim(PG[V ] ) ≤ k. Accordingly, Proposition 2 is rephrased in the following lemma for the graphs G and

that of H.

Theorem 5. Let G and G be comparability graphs such that Rp (G) = k and
Rp (G′ ) = k ′ . If the graph H is a comparability graph, then Rp (H) = max{k, k ′ }
or 1 + max{k, k ′ }.
Proof. Suppose H is a comparability graph. By Theorem 3, m is a source and m′
is a sink with respect to some transitive orientations of G and G′ , respectively.
As Rp (G) = k and Rp (G′ ) = k ′ , using Lemma 2, consider the permutations
pi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) on V , p′i (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ ) on V ′ , qi (1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1) on the vertices of G,
and qi′ (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ + 1) on the vertices of G′ such that the words w = q1 q2 ⋯qk qk+1
and w′ = q1′ q2′ ⋯qk′ ′ qk′ ′ +1 represent the graphs G and G′ , respectively.
Suppose k ′ ≤ k. We construct k + 1 number of permutations ui (1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1)
on the vertices of H as per the following:
u1 = p′1 mp1 m′ ,
ui = p′i mm′ pi , (2 ≤ i ≤ k ′ )
uj = p′k′ mm′ pj ,

We now show that the word u = u1 u2 ⋯uk uk+1 represents the graph H. Note
that H[V ∪ {m}] = G and H[V ′ ∪ {m′ }] = G′ . Further, since
uV ∪{m} = q1 q2 ⋯ qk qk+1 , and
k−k′ +1

uV ′ ∪{m′ } = q1′ q2′ ⋯ qk′ ′ −1 qk′ ′ ⋯ qk′ ′ qk′ ′ +1 ,
we have uV ∪{m} and uV ′ ∪{m′ } represent the graphs G and G′ , respectively. Hence,
any two vertices of G or of G′ are adjacent if and only if they alternate in the
word u. Also, corresponding to the edge mm′ in H, it is easy to see that m and
m′ alternate in u, as mm′ ⪯ ui for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1.
Note that there are no edges between the graphs G and G′ except mm′ ;
accordingly, we show that the corresponding vertices do not alternate in u. For
a ∈ V and a′ ∈ V ′ ∪ {m′ }, as a′ a ⪯ u2 but aa′ ⪯ uk+1 , it is evident that a and a′
do not alternate in u. Also, for a ∈ V ∪ {m} and a′ ∈ V ′ , we have a and a′ do
not alternate in u as a′ a ⪯ u1 but aa′ ⪯ uk+1 . Hence, the word u represents the
graph H.

12

Similarly, when k ≤ k ′ , we can show that the word u = u1 u2 ⋯uk′ uk′ +1 represents the graph H, where
u1 = p′1 mp1 m′ ;
ui = p′i mm′ pi , (2 ≤ i ≤ k);
uj = p′j mm′ pk ,

In any case, since u is a concatenation of 1 + max{k, k ′ } number of permutations, we have Rp (H) ≤ 1 + max{k, k ′ }. Also, since G and G′ are induced
subgraphs of H, we have Rp (H) ≥ max{k, k ′ }. Hence, Rp (H) = max{k, k ′ } or
1 + max{k, k ′ }.

Theorem 6. Let G and G′ be comparability graphs such that m is a source
of G and m′ is a sink of G′ with respect to some transitive orientations of G
and G′ . If Rp (G) = k and Rp (G′ ) = k ′ , then Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ } or
1 + max{k, k ′ }.
Proof. Let us assume that m is a source of G and m′ is a sink of G′ with respect
to some transitive orientations of G and G′ . Then, by Theorem 4, G m ⍟m′ G′ is
a comparability graph and hence permutationally representable. As Rp (G) = k
and Rp (G′ ) = k ′ , using Lemma 2, consider the permutations pi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) on V ,
p′i (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ ) on V ′ , qi (1 ≤ i ≤ k + 1) on the vertices of G, and qi′ (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ + 1)
on the vertices of G′ such that the words w = q1 q2 ⋯qk qk+1 and w′ = q1′ q2′ ⋯qk′ ′ qk′ ′ +1
represent the graphs G and G′ , respectively.
Suppose k ≤ k ′ . We construct k ′ + 1 number of permutations vi (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ + 1)
on the vertices of G m ⍟m′ G′ as per the following:

We now show that the word v = v1 v2 ⋯vk′ vk′ +1 represents the graph G m ⍟m′ G′ .
Note that G[V ] and G′ [V ′ ] are induced subgraphs of G m ⍟m′ G′ represented by
wV = p1 p2 ⋯ pk pkV ∖NG (m) pkNG (m) , and

Thus, any two vertices of G[V ] or of G′ [V ′ ] are adjacent if and only if they
alternate in the word v.
For a ∈ V and a′ ∈ V ′ , note that a and a′ are adjacent in G m ⍟m′ G′ if and
only if a ∈ NG (m) and a′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ). Accordingly, we consider the following cases
to show that a and a′ are adjacent in G m ⍟m′ G′ if and only if they alternate
in v. If a ∈ NG (m) and a′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ), then from the construction of v, we have
a′ a ⪯ vi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ + 1, so that a and a′ alternate in v. If a ∉ NG (m),
then for any a′ ∈ V ′ , we have a′ a ⪯ v1 but aa′ ⪯ vk′ +1 . Similarly, if a′ ∉ NG′ (m′ ),
then for any vertex a ∈ V , we have a′ a ⪯ v1 but aa′ ⪯ vk′ +1 . Hence, a and a′ do
not alternate in v, if a ∉ NG (m) or a′ ∉ NG′ (m′ ). Hence the word v represents
G m ⍟m′ G′ permutationally.
Similarly, when k ′ ≤ k, we can show that the word v = v1 v2 ⋯vk vk+1 represents
the graph G m ⍟m′ G′ permutationally, where
vi = p′i pi , (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ );

In any case, since v is a concatenation of 1 + max{k, k ′ } number of permutations, we have Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≤ 1 + max{k, k ′ }. Also, since G and G′
are isomorphic to certain induced subgraphs of G m ⍟m′ G′ (cf. Remark 1), we
have Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≥ max{k, k ′ }. Hence, Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ } or
1 + max{k, k ′ }.
⊔
⊓
In view of Corollary 4, we have the following corollary of Theorem 6.
Corollary 5. If G and G′ are bipartite graphs with Rp (G) = k and Rp (G′ ) = k ′ ,
then Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ } or 1 + max{k, k ′ }.

Characterization

In summary, we obtained a transitive orientation for a recomposition of comparability graphs when the marked vertices are source and sink with respect to
their transitive orientations. However, the marked vertices need not be source
or sink to give a transitive orientation to the recomposition, as shown in the
following example.
Example 2. Consider the comparability graphs G1 and G2 given in Fig. 2 in
which a and b are the marked vertices. Note that b is not a source or sink under
any transitive orientation given to G2 . However, G1 a ⍟b G2 is a comparability
graph.
However, in Example 2, the vertex a is an all-adjacent vertex, i.e., a is adjacent to all other vertices of G1 . In connection to this observation we prove the
following theorem.

Fig. 2. Recomposition of comparability graphs

Theorem 7. Let G and G′ be two comparability graphs such that at least one
of m and m′ is an all-adjacent vertex. Then G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph.
Moreover, if Rp (G) = k and Rp (G′ ) = k ′ , then Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ }.
Proof. We prove the result by constructing requisite number of permutations on
the vertices of G m ⍟m′ G′ whose concatenation represents G m ⍟m′ G′ .
Let the words p1 p2 ⋯pk and p′1 p′2 ⋯p′k′ represent G and G′ , respectively, where
each pi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is a permutation on the vertices of G and each p′i (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ )
is a permutation on the vertices of G′ .
Suppose max{k, k ′ } = t. If k ′ < k, then set p′j = p′k′ for all k ′ + 1 ≤ j ≤ t
and note that p′1 p′2 ⋯p′t represents G′ . Similarly, if k < k ′ , then set pj = pk for
all k + 1 ≤ j ≤ t and note that p1 p2 ⋯pt represents G. In any case, the words
w = p1 p2 ⋯pt and w′ = p′1 p′2 ⋯p′t represent the graphs G and G′ , respectively. For
1 ≤ i ≤ t, let pi = ri msi and p′i = ri′ m′ s′i so that piV = ri si and p′iV ′ = ri′ s′i .
Suppose m is an all-adjacent vertex of G. Let ui = ri′ ri si s′i , for all 1 ≤ i ≤ t.
Note that each ui is a permutation on the vertices of G m ⍟m′ G′ . We show that
the word u = u1 u2 ⋯ut represents the graph G m ⍟m′ G′ permutationally.
Note that the induced subgraphs G[V ] and G′ [V ′ ] are induced subgraphs
of G m ⍟m′ G′ . Further, since uV = p1V p2V ⋯ptV = wV and uV ′ = p′1V ′ p′2V ′ ⋯p′tV ′ =
wV′ ′ , the subwords uV and uV ′ of u represent the graphs G[V ] and G′ [V ′ ],
respectively. Thus, any two vertices of G[V ] or of G′ [V ′ ] are adjacent if and
only if they alternate in the word u.
For a ∈ V and a′ ∈ V ′ , note that a and a′ are adjacent in G m ⍟m′ G′ if and
only if a ∈ NG (m) and a′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ). However, note that V = NG (m) as m is
an all-adjacent vertex of G. Accordingly, we consider the two cases based on
a′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ) or not to show that a and a′ are adjacent in G m ⍟m′ G′ if and only
if they alternate in u so that u represents the graph G m ⍟m′ G′ .
– Case-1: a′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ). Since w′ represents G′ , we have a′ m′ ⪯ p′i for all i, or
m′ a′ ⪯ p′i for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ t. Observe that each ui (1 ≤ i ≤ t) is constructed
from p′i by replacing m′ with the permutation piV . Hence, if a′ m′ ⪯ p′i for all
i, then a′ a ⪯ ui for all i. If m′ a′ ⪯ p′i for all i, then aa′ ⪯ ui for all i. In any
case, a and a′ alternate in u.
– Case-2: a′ ∉ NG′ (m′ ). Then a′ and m′ do not alternate in w′ . Accordingly,
there exist i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ t) such that a′ m′ ⪯ p′i and m′ a′ ⪯ p′j . Again, as

15

per the construction of ui and uj , we have a′ a ⪯ ui and aa′ ⪯ uj . Hence, a
and a′ do not alternate in u.
Similarly, if m′ is an all-adjacent vertex of G′ , we can show that the word u =
u1 u2 ⋯ut represents the graph G m ⍟m′ G′ permutationally, where ui = ri ri′ s′i si ,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ t.
Therefore, we have Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≤ t = max{k, k ′ }. But, by Remark 1, since
G and G′ are isomorphic to certain induced subgraphs of G m ⍟m′ G′ , we have
⊔
⊓
Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≥ t. Hence, Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ }.
We now recall a theorem that characterizes a source of a comparability graph
using a graph that is constructed as follows. Let v be a vertex of a graph C and
C v be the graph obtained from C by adding a new vertex v ′ adjacent only to
the vertex v of C. Then we have the following theorem.
Theorem 8 ([16,29]). Let C be a comparability graph and v be a vertex of C.
Then v is a source with respect to some transitive orientation of C if and only
if C v is a comparability graph.
Now, using Theorem 8, we find a necessary and sufficient condition to make
G m ⍟m′ G′ a comparability graph, when one of m and m′ is not a source (or
sink) with respect to any transitive orientation of G or G′ .
Theorem 9. Let G and G′ be two comparability graphs such that m is not a
source with respect to any transitive orientation of G. If G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph, then m′ is an all-adjacent vertex of G′ .
Proof. Let G m ⍟m′ G′ be a comparability graph. Assume m′ is not an all-adjacent
vertex of G′ . Then there exists a vertex c′ ∈ V ′ such that c′ ∉ NG′ (m′ ) but
b′ c′ ∈ E ′ for some vertex b′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ). The connectedness of the graph G′
ensures the existence of such vertex c′ .
Consider the induced subgraph (G m ⍟m′ G′ )[V ∪ {b′ }], say m Gb′ . Note that
′
b is adjacent to all vertices of NG (m) in G m ⍟m′ G′ . Hence, m Gb′ is isomorphic
to G as it can be obtained from G by replacing m with b′ . While m Gb′ is a comparability graph, b′ cannot be a source with respect to any transitive orientation
of m Gb′ , as G does.
Now consider the induced subgraph (G m ⍟m′ G′ )[V ∪ {b′ , c′ }] of G m ⍟m′ G′ .
′
Note that (G m ⍟m′ G′ )[V ∪ {b′ , c′ }] = (m Gb′ )b , the graph obtained from m Gb′
′
by making c′ adjacent only to b′ . Since b′ cannot be a source, (m Gb′ )b is not
′
a comparability graph, by Theorem 8. However, (m Gb′ )b is a comparability
graph as it is an induced subgraph of the comparability graph G m ⍟m′ G′ ; a
contradiction. Hence, m′ should be an all-adjacent vertex of G′ .
⊔
⊓
We summarize the results of this section in the following theorem.
Theorem 10. Let G = (V ∪ {m}, E) and G′ = (V ′ ∪ {m′ }, E ′ ) be two comparability graphs with disjoint vertex sets. Suppose Rp (G) = k and Rp (G′ ) = k ′ .
Then we have the following:

16

1. The split recomposition G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph if and only if
one of the following holds:
– The vertices m and m′ are source and sink, or vice versa, with respect
to some transitive orientations on G and G′ .
– At least one of the vertices m and m′ is an all-adjacent vertex.
2. Moreover, if the split recomposition G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph, then
Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ } or 1 + max{k, k ′ }.
As a consequence, we also provide the prn of the graph construction Gm in
the following corollary.
Corollary 6. Let G be a comparability graph such that Rp (G) = k. If Gm is a
comparability graph, then Rp (Gm ) = k or 1 + k.
Proof. If Gm is a comparability graph, then by Theorem 8, m is a source of G.
m′ b a
and note that Rp (P3 ) = 2, as the word bam′ bm′ a
Consider a path P3 :
represents P3 , which is not a complete graph. Further, it can be observed that
Gm is isomorphic to G m ⍟m′ P3 .
If k = 1, then G is a complete graph so that m is an all-adjacent vertex
of G. Accordingly, by Theorem 7, Rp (Gm ) = Rp (G m ⍟m′ P3 ) = max{1, 2} = 2.
Otherwise, for k ≥ 2, max{k, 2} = k. Then, by Theorem 10, Rp (Gm ) = k or 1 + k.
Hence, in any case, we have Rp (Gm ) = k or 1 + k.

prn-Irreducible Graphs

Following the notion of irreducible posets in order theory (cf. [34]), in this section, we define the concept of prn-irreducible comparability graphs and study
them with respect to split recomposition. In this connection, we characterize
prn-irreducible graphs such that their recomposition is a comparability graph.
Accordingly, we determine the prn of the resultant comparability graph based
on the prns of its split components. We also observe that the split recomposition
of prn-irreducible graphs is not prn-irreducible.
Definition 1. A comparability graph C = (V, E) is said to be k-prn-irreducible
for some k ≥ 2, if Rp (C) = k and Rp (C[V ∖{a}]) = k−1 for every a ∈ V . Further,
a comparability graph is said to be prn-irreducible if it is k-prn-irreducible for
some k ≥ 2.
Remark 5. A comparability graph is 2-prn-irreducible if and only if it is an
edgeless graph on two vertices. For instance, any connected graph C on at least
3 vertices with Rp (C) = 2 has a vertex a that is not adjacent to all other vertices.
If we remove any vertex adjacent to a from C, the prn of the resultant graph is
not one, as it is not a complete graph.
Example 3. For n ≥ 3, consider the crown graph Hn,n (a graph which is obtained
by deleting a perfect matching from the complete bipartite graph Kn,n ). From

17

[19], recall that Rp (Hn,n ) = n. Let H ′ be the bipartite graph obtained by deleting
a vertex from Hn,n . Note that Rp (H ′ ) ≤ n − 1 as n − 1 is the size of one of the
partite sets of H ′ , and n − 1 ≤ Rp (H ′ ) as Hn−1,n−1 is an induced subgraph of H ′
(cf. [28]). Hence, Rp (H ′ ) = n − 1 so that Hn,n is n-prn-irreducible.
Example 4. For n ≥ 3, the cycle C2n is 3-prn-irreducible. Note that by deleting a
vertex from C2n we get the path P2n−1 with 2n−1 vertices. For n ≥ 3, Rp (C2n ) = 3
and Rp (Pn ) = 2 (cf. [27]).
Trotter and Moore, as well as Kelly independently and simultaneously obtained the complete list of 3-irreducible posets [23,35]. A complete list of 3-prnirreducible comparability graphs can be derived from the corresponding posets.
Proposition 3. For k ≥ 2, any k-prn-irreducible comparability graph does not
have an all-adjacent vertex.
Proof. On the contrary, suppose a is an all-adjacent vertex of a k-prn-irreducible
comparability graph C = (V, E). As Rp (C[V ∖ {a}]) = k − 1, let p1 p2 ⋯pk−1
represents the induced subgraph C[V ∖ {a}], where each pi (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) is
a permutation on V ∖ {a}. Then consider the permutations qi = api , for all
1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, on V and note that the word q1 q2 ⋯qk−1 represents the graph C.
Hence, Rp (C) = k − 1; a contradiction.
⊔
⊓
In view of Proposition 3, we have the following corollary of Theorem 10.
Corollary 7. Let G and G′ be comparability graphs such that G is k-prn-irreducible
and G′ is k ′ -prn-irreducible. Then G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph if and only
if m is a source of G and m′ is a sink of G′ with respect to some transitive orientations of G and G′ .
We now obtain the permutation-representation number of a split recomposition of two prn-irreducible comparability graphs in the following theorem.
Theorem 11. For k, k ′ ≥ 3, let G and G′ be k-prn-irreducible and k ′ -prnirreducible comparability graphs, respectively. If G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability
graph, then Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ }.
Proof. Suppose G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph. In view of Corollary 7,
let m be a source of G and m′ be a sink of G′ with respect to some transitive
orientations of G and G′ . Note that Rp (G) = k, Rp (G′ ) = k ′ and Rp (G[V ]) =
k−1, Rp (G′ [V ′ ]) = k ′ −1. Along the lines of Lemma 2, consider the permutations
pi (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1) on V , p′i (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ − 1) on V ′ , qi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) on the vertices of
G, and qi′ (1 ≤ i ≤ k ′ ) on the vertices of G′ such that the words w = q1 q2 ⋯qk−1 qk
and w′ = q1′ q2′ ⋯qk′ ′ −1 qk′ ′ represent the graphs G and G′ , respectively, where
qi = mpi , (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1);

Suppose k ′ ≤ k. We construct k number of permutations vi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) on the

Thus, any two vertices of G[V ] or of G′ [V ′ ] are adjacent if and only if they
alternate in the word v.
For a ∈ V and a′ ∈ V ′ , note that a and a′ are adjacent in G m ⍟m′ G′ if and
only if a ∈ NG (m) and a′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ). Accordingly, we consider the following cases
to show that a and a′ are adjacent in G m ⍟m′ G′ if and only if they alternate
in v. If a ∈ NG (m) and a′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ), then from the construction of v, we have
a′ a ⪯ vi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, so that a and a′ alternate in v. If a ∉ NG (m), then for
any a′ ∈ V ′ , we have a′ a ⪯ v1 but aa′ ⪯ vk . Similarly, if a′ ∉ NG′ (m′ ), then for
any vertex a ∈ V , we have a′ a ⪯ v1 but aa′ ⪯ vk . Hence, a and a′ do not alternate
in v, if a ∉ NG (m) or a′ ∉ NG′ (m′ ). Hence the word v represents G m ⍟m′ G′
permutationally.
Similarly, when k ≤ k ′ , we can show that the word v = v1 v2 ⋯vk′ −1 vk′ represents the graph G m ⍟m′ G′ permutationally, where
vi = p′i pi , (1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1);
vj = p′j pk−1 , (k ≤ j ≤ k ′ − 1);
vk′ = pk−1V ∖NG (m) p′k′ −1N

In any case, since v is a concatenation of max{k, k ′ } number of permutations, we have Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≤ max{k, k ′ }. Also, since G and G′ are isomorphic to certain induced subgraphs of G m ⍟m′ G′ (cf. Remark 1), we have
⊔
⊓
Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) ≥ max{k, k ′ }. Hence, Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = max{k, k ′ }.
In view of Theorem 11, we have the prn of following bipartite graphs which
are obtained from the recomposition of prn-irreducible graphs.

Example 5. For k, k ′ ≥ 3, the prn of the recomposition of crown graphs Hk,k and
Hk′ ,k′ is max{k, k ′ }.
Example 6. For k, k ′ ≥ 3, the prn of the recomposition of even cycles C2k and
C2k′ is 3.
Theorem 12. For k, k ′ ≥ 3, if G and G′ be k-prn-irreducible and k ′ -prn-irreducible
comparability graphs, respectively, then G m ⍟m′ G′ is not prn-irreducible.
Proof. Suppose G m ⍟m′ G′ is a comparability graph. By Proposition 3, m and
m′ are not all-adjacent vertices. Also, by Theorem 11, we have Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) =
max{k, k ′ } = k, say, without loss of generality.
Since m′ is not an all-adjacent vertex of G′ , there exists c′ ∈ V ′ such that
′
c ∉ NG′ (m′ ). Consider the induced subgraph L = (G m ⍟m′ G′ )[V ∪ (V ′ ∖ {c′ })].
Clearly, Rp (L) ≤ k. We show that Rp (L) = k so that G m ⍟m′ G′ is not prnirreducible.
For b′ ∈ NG′ (m′ ), note that the induced subgraph (G m ⍟m′ G′ )[V ∪ {b′ }] is
isomorphic to G and it is also an induced subgraph of L. Thus, Rp (L) ≥ k and
hence, Rp (L) = k.

Conclusion

This work paves a way, in general, to study the word-representability of graphs
using split decomposition and recomposition. As the problem of deciding whether
a given graph is word-representable is NP-complete, using split decomposition
and recomposition, the problem can be reduced to its prime components. For
example, the parity graphs are established as word-representable, because their
prime components are word-representable (see Corollary 3). In view of Corollary
2, the open problem of characterizing word-representable perfect graphs can be
approached through the following problem: What are the prime perfect graphs
that are not word-representable? Similar to bipartite graphs, it is also interesting
to find the subclasses of comparability graphs which are closed under recomposition. If one of the marked vertices is an all-adjacent vertex in a general case, or in
the case G and G′ are prn-irreducible graphs, we proved that Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = κ,
where κ = max{Rp (G), Rp (G′ )}. However, there are two categories of prn for
the recomposed comparability graph, i.e., Rp (G m ⍟m′ G′ ) = κ or 1 + κ. Accordingly, one may target to classify the graphs with respect to the prn of their
recomposition amongst the two categories.
