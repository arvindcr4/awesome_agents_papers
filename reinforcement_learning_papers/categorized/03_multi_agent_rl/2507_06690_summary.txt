**TITLE**: Multi-Task Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Skill Graphs
**ARXIV_ID**: 2507.06690v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a hierarchical approach to multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (MT-MARL) using a skill graph. The skill graph is constructed using knowledge graph embedding (KGE) and is used to select and combine skills for different tasks and environments. The approach is evaluated in simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* Proposes a hierarchical approach to MT-MARL using a skill graph
* Constructs a skill graph using KGE to represent tasks, environments, and skills
* Evaluates the approach in simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling unrelated tasks and enhancing knowledge transfer
* Compares the approach to hierarchical MAPPO, showing its advantages in generalization and knowledge transfer.
