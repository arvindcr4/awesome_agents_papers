**TITLE:** Revisiting Some Common Practices in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The authors revisit two common practices in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL): value decomposition and policy sharing. They provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to show that these practices can lead to suboptimal performance in certain scenarios, and propose alternative approaches to improve the performance of MARL algorithms.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The authors show that value decomposition methods can fail to represent the underlying payoff structure in certain games, leading to suboptimal performance.
* They propose an auto-regressive policy representation that can learn multi-modal behaviors and improve the performance of MARL algorithms.
* The authors evaluate their approach on several benchmark environments, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research Football, and demonstrate its effectiveness in learning diverse and coordinated behaviors.
* They provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of value decomposition and policy sharing, and discuss the implications of their findings for the development of more effective MARL algorithms.
