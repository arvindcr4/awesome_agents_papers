TITLE: CAMAR: Continuous Actions Multi-Agent Routing
ARXIV_ID: 2508.12845v2
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: CAMAR is a multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark designed for continuous-space planning tasks in multi-agent environments. It supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
- CAMAR introduces a new benchmark for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions.
- The environment supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents.
- CAMAR includes a standardized evaluation protocol with built-in metrics and a range of strong baselines from both classical and learning-based methods.
- The environment is designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to simulate thousands of agents.
- CAMAR provides a simple and flexible interface for building custom multi-agent pathfinding environments.
