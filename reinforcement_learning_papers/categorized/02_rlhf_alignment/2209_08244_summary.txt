**ARXIV_ID:** 2209.08244v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (although not explicitly stated, the paper is related to reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a minimalist approach to fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning, called Multi-Agent Alternate Q-Learning (MA2QL). MA2QL is a simple yet effective value-based decentralized learning method that requires minimal changes to independent Q-learning (IQL). In MA2QL, agents take turns updating their Q-functions by Q-learning, whereas in IQL, agents update their Q-functions simultaneously.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* MA2QL is theoretically grounded and has a convergence guarantee to a Nash equilibrium.
* MA2QL outperforms IQL in various cooperative multi-agent tasks, including a didactic game, multi-agent particle environments (MPE), multi-agent MuJoCo, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC).
* MA2QL is robust to different hyperparameters, exploration schemes, and environmental stochasticity.
* MA2QL has good scalability and can handle more complex tasks with larger state and action spaces.

Overall, the paper contributes to the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning by providing a simple yet effective decentralized learning method that can handle complex tasks and has good scalability.
