Abstract Snippet:
arXiv:2412.10256v2 [math.CO] 15 Apr 2025  THE BBDVW CONJECTURE FOR KAZHDAN–LUSZTIG POLYNOMIALS OF LOWER INTERVALS GRANT T. BARKLEY AND CHRISTIAN GAETZ Abstract. Blundell, Buesing, Davies, Veličković, and Williamson (BBDVW) introduced the notion of a hypercube decomposition of an interval in Bruhat order. They conjectured a recursive formula in terms of this structure which, if shown for all intervals, would imply the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of Lusztig and Dyer, for Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials of the symmetric group. In this article, we prove implications between the BBDVW Conject...
