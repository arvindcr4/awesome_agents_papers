Abstract—Prescribed-time (PT) control, originated from Song et al.,
has gained increasing attention among control community. The salient
feature of PT control lies in its ability to achieve system stability within
a finite settling time user-assignable in advance irrespective of initial
conditions. It is such a unique feature that has enticed many follow-up
studies on this technically important area, motivating numerous research
advancements. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the
recent developments in PT control. Through a concise introduction to
the concept of PT control, and a unique taxonomy covering: 1) from
robust PT control to adaptive PT control; 2) from PT control for singleinput-single-output (SISO) systems to multi-input-multi-output (MIMO)
systems; and 3) from PT control for single systems to multi-agent systems,
we present an accessible review of this interesting topic. We highlight key
techniques, fundamental assumptions adopted in various developments
as well as some new design ideas. We also discuss several possibles future
research directions towards PT control.

He notion of prescribed-time control, originally proposed by
Song, Wang, Holloway and Krstic [1], has brought much vitality
to finite-time (FT) control, attracting increasing attention from the
control community and motivating numerous follow-up studies on
this important field during the past few years [2]–[52]. Examining
the development history of FT control theory reveals that the related
concepts can be traced back to the 1960s, when the concept of FT
stability was proposed in [53]–[55], with application to certain simple
linear systems. A system is considered to be FT stable if, given a
bounded initial condition, all closed-loop signals are bounded and
its states converge to zero (or a residual set) within a specified FT
interval. It is essential to identify FT stability and asymptotic stability.
In fact, a system can be FT stable but not asymptotically stable,
and vice versa. Asymptotic stability corresponds to the behavior of a
system within a sufficiently long (in principle, infinite) time interval,
while FT stability is a more practical concept that helps to study the
behavior of the closed-loop system over a finite (possibly short) time
interval, and hence it finds application whenever it is desired/required
that the system states shrink to a certain small threshold (for example,
to avoid saturation or the excitation of nonlinear dynamics) within a
short period of time.
The past few decades have witnessed much progress in FT control
of dynamic systems [56]–[67]. The homogeneous approach, terminal
sliding mode control method, and adding a power integrator method
are suggested sequentially in an attempt to achieve FT stability for
high-order nonlinear systems [68]–[72]. Although convergence may
be pursued in a finite time, estimation of the settling time relies
explicitly on initial conditions. This may limit the application scope
of those existing results when little knowledge of plant initial states
are accessible. Later on a notion termed fixed-time (FxT) control
[73]–[79] has emerged, which employs odd-order plus fractionalorder feedback to provide various closed-loop system dynamics. The
upper bound of the settling time can be estimated without using any
information on initial conditions.

Despite the benefits of FxT control in the light of settling time
estimation, no simple and obvious relationship exists between the
control parameters and the intended upper-bound of the settling
time. In addition, the settling time under the FxT control is often
overestimated, which may be hundreds or even thousands of times
larger than the true settling time, resulting in an inaccurate description
of system performance. On the other hand, the settling time is not a
directly tuneable parameter for either FT control or FxT control, as it
also depends on other controller design parameters. To alleviate the
problem of overestimation of the settling time while alleviating the
dependence of the settling time on design parameters, the predefinedtime control (PdT control) approach is exploited in [80]–[83], where
the least upper bound of the settling time can be preset irrespective
of initial conditions and any other design parameters.
Recently, the classical idea that originated in strategic and tactical
missile guidance applications [84]–[86] has been revisited and further
applied to high-order nonlinear systems, namely PT control, which
inherits the advantages of FT control, FxT control, PdT control and
also allows for presetting the settling time precisely. This concept is
of great importance in many practical engineering applications where
transient processes must occur within a given time (e.g., missile
guidance, multi-agent rendezvous, emergency braking, and obstacle
avoidance in robotic systems, etc.).
More importantly, the PT control is promising since it is robust
to external disturbances, the control input is always smooth over the
transient process, and there is no need for any information on the
upper bound of the non-vanishing perturbations in the control design.
The key technical design steps for PT control include: converting the
original system to a new system by a time-varying transformation
(including state scaling, time scaling, and some other technologies),
dealing with matching/mismatching uncertainties and unknown control coefficients to construct appropriate Lyapunov inequalities, and
selecting the appropriate control gain k to prove the boundedness
of all closed-loop signals, especially the boundedness of the control
inputs. Furthermore, because all real PT controllers have infinite gain
characteristics as time tends to the pre-set time, they can only be
used for a finite time interval. Many infinite time controllers may be
integrated with PT algorithms to deliver their infinite time features
inside a prescribed-time window, thereby extending the use of PT
control systems. In this article, we perform a complete study on
several important theoretical breakthroughs, key technical concerns,
and potential research problems in PT control, as well as provide a
comprehensive literature survey.
The study will start next in Section II with an overview of
some basic propositions of FT/FxT/PdT and PT control. Section
III lists some specific literature on PT control for SISO systems
and provides some basic design ideas of prescribed robust and/or
adaptive controller design, focused on the introduction of state scaling
technology and time scaling technology on PT control. Section IV
lists some state-of-the-art results on MIMO systems and presents
a detailed demonstration of PT control for this type of system. It
covers square and non-square MIMO systems. Section V lists some
interesting studies on PT distributed control and addresses some
basic issues of PT control for multi-agent systems. The organization
of Sections II-V is shown in Fig. 1. Section VI provides some

possible open areas of research.

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Definitions
We first consider some basic definitions of infinite-time (asymptotic/exponential) stability:
Definition 1 ([95], Ch. 4): For a non-autonomous system as
ẋ = f (x, t)

q < 1, then the closed-loop system is FT stable and the settling time
is calculated by
1
T :=
V 1−q (x(0)).
k(1 − α)

(1)

where f : Rn ×[0, ∞) → Rn is piecewise continuous in t and locally
Lipschitz in x. The equilibrium point x = 0 is
• stable, if there exists a class of K function β such that kx(t)k ≤
β(kx(0)k);
1
• asymptotically stable , if it is stable, and x(t) → 0 as t → ∞;
• exponentially stable, if there exist two positive numbers, λ1
and λ2 , such that for sufficiently small x(0), kx(t)k ≤
λ1 kx(0)ke−λ2 t , ∀t ≥ 0.

The definitions of FT and FxT stability are stated as below:
Definition 2 ([73], Ch. 4): For a system as (1), the equilibrium
point x = 0 is
• finite-time stable, if it is stable and there exists a x(0)-dependent
settling time function T (x(0)) such that x(t) = 0 for t ≥
T (x(0));
• fixed-time stable, if it is stable and the settling time function
T (x(0)) is upper bounded on R, i.e., ∃ Tmax > 0, x(t) =
0 for t ≥ Tmax .
Obviously, the terminal time always attaches itself to x(0) in FT
control, such attachment is however removed in FxT control. An
astonishing scenario in FT/FxT stability is the PT stability, where
the terminal time has nothing to do with initial condition, thus can
be user-set freely in advance.
B. Propositions on Finite-/Fixed-/Predefined-/Prescribed-time Stability
Achieving FT stability for dynamic systems is of special theoretical
and practical interest. The typical approach for establishing FT
stability is to derive Lyapunov differential inequalities. Most of
these inequalities can be found in the following works which are
summarized as a variety of propositions:
Proposition 1 ([69]): For system ẋ = f (x, t), if there exists a C 1
function V (x) ≥ 0 such that V̇ (x) ≤ −kV q (x), where k > 0, 0 <
1 If x(0) ∈ (−∞, +∞), here we say that the equilibrium point is global
asymptotically stable.

Proposition 4 ([66]): For system ẋ = f (x, t), if there exists a
C 1 function V (x) ≥ 0 such that V̇ (x) ≤ −kV q (x) + η where
k > 0, 0 < η < ∞ and 0 < q < 1, then the closed-loop system is

function V (x) ≥ 0 such that V̇ (x) ≤ −k1 V q (x)−k2 V (x)+η where
k1 > 0, k2 > 0, 0 < η < ∞ and 0 < q < 1, then the closed-loop

(4)

for unknown perturbation d(t) and a positive number k, then V (t)

The connections and differences among the aforementioned stability notions are conceptually highlighted in Fig. 2. Basically, PT
stability is most “desirable”, which covers PdT stability, FxT stability,
and of course FT stability, and FxT stability implies FT stability, but
the reverse does not necessarily hold.

Fig. 2. The relationships among FT/FxT/PdT and PT control. Key features: FT
control—the settling time is related to initial conditions and design parameters;
FxT control—the settling time can be estimated by an upper bounded function
independent of initial conditions; PdT control—the upper bound of the settling
time can be user-set freely; and PT control—the exact settling time can be
user-assigned arbitrarily.

Propositions 1-5 indicate that the terminal time T attaches itself to
several design parameters (e.g., b, c, α, etc.), and the initial system
state V (x(0)). Propositions 6-9 show that the settling time T is
bounded by a computable function, which is independent of the
initial condition V (x(0)), whereas Propositions 10-12 indicate that
the settling time T can be pre-set at users’ will irrespective of initial
conditions and any other design parameter. To close this section, we
summarize the contents of Propositions 1-12 through Table 1.

III. P RESCRIBED - TIME CONTROL FOR SISO SYSTEMS
In this section, we focus on several fundamental topics in PT
control, such as robust control and adaptive control based on timevarying feedback, as well as some associated technical concerns
including system state convergence, the boundedness of control input,
and the boundedness of parameter estimations. Before this, we review
the related concepts on PT control.
A. Preliminaries on prescribed-time control
Definition 3 ([5]): System (1) is PT globally uniformly asymptotically stable in time T if there exist a function µ : [0, T ) → R+ with
µ increasing to ∞ as t → T and a class KL function β such that,
kx(t)k ≤ β (kx (0)k , µ (t)) , ∀t ∈ [0, T ) ,

(6)

where T is a finite number that can be prescribed in the design.
Definition 4 ([1]): The system ẋ = f (x, t, d) (d represents nonvanishing perturbations) is PT globally uniformly asymptotically
stable in time T if there exist class KL functions β and βf , a class
K function γ, and a time-varying function µ(t) : [0, T ) → R+ with
µ(t) approaching to ∞ as t → T such that,


kx(t)k ≤ βf β (kx(0)k, t) + γ kdk[0,t] , µ(t) , ∀t ∈ [0, T ) . (7)
Clearly, Definition 4 is a generalization of Definition 3 in the
presence of non-vanishing perturbations in the system.
To achieve PT convergence, two general PT controller design
approaches, namely state scaling based approach and time scaling
based approach, are used in the literature:

State scaling: Using a monotonically increasing function µ(t)
that grows to infinity in finite time T to scale the state, thereby
constructing a new variable z = µx. A control design that keeps
z bounded will implicitly make x go to zero as t → T .
• Time scaling: Using a nonlinear temporal transformation τ =
a(t) with a(t) being a function defined such that a(0) = 0
and limt→T a(t) = ∞. Since this time scale transformation
maps t ∈ [0, T ) to τ ∈ [0, ∞). A control design that achieves
asymptotic convergence in the light of the time variable τ
implicitly achieves PT convergence in terms of the time variable
t.

•

The basis of state scaling based design is the monotonically increasing function:
T
µ(t) =
, t ∈ [0, T )
(8)
T −t

where T > 0, with the properties that µ(0) = 1 and µ(T ) = +∞.
In addition, the basis of time scaling based design is a temporal
axis mapping τ = a(t),2 with the properties defined as follows.
Let a′ (t) = da
and α(τ ) = a′ (a−1 (τ )), i.e., α(τ ) is the funcdt
tion da
expressed
in the light of the new time variable τ. Also,
dt
dτ = a′ (t)dt = α(τ )dt.3
a(0) > 0 and a(T ) = +∞;
a(t) is continuously differentiable on t ∈ [0, T );
′
• a (t) > 0 and grows to infinite as t → T.
•

•

Here we provide an overview on some typical works in PT control,
most of which were initially for stabilization of SISO systems within
2 A common time scaling is t = T (1−e−τ ), i.e., a(t) = ln T −ln(T −t).
In this case, α(τ ) = eτ /T .
3 Since both x(t) and x̆(τ ) relate to the value of the same signal at the
same physical time point represented as t in the original time axis and τ in
the converted time axis, we use the notation x̆(τ ) to express a signal x(t)
as a function of the transformed time variable τ , i.e., x(t) ≡ x̆(τ ). Hence,

The representative results of the PT control for SISO systems via
time-varying feedback are summarized in Table 2. Most of them are
based on state feedback. Due to the difficulties of designing complex
uncertain systems, most results assume that the control coefficients
(including the control direction) of the system model are precisely
known without nonvanishing perturbations in the system. In addition,
most results consider only robust control schemes and do not consider
adaptive control schemes. Because in adaptive control, it is necessary
to guarantee the boundedness of parameter estimation (it seems to be
difficult to do this with the state scaling based PT control approach) in
addition to the boundedness of the control signal, which usually poses
a challenge for the controller design. The following about robust and
adaptive PT control will be addressed.
B. Robust prescribed-time control
In this subsection, we adopt the state scaling method to design
a control u(t) to stabilize a scalar system with unknown control
coefficient and non-vanishing perturbation in prescribed time T .
Consider:
ẋ = b(x, t)u + f (x, t)
(9)
where x and u are the state and the control input, respectively,
b(x, t) and f (x, t) are nonlinear time-varying functions and satisfy
the following assumptions.
Assumption 1 ([1]): The function f (x, t) is smooth and satisfies
|f (x, t)| ≤ d(t)ψ(x), where d(t) is a bounded but unknown
perturbation, and ψ(x) ≥ 0 is a known computable function.
Assumption 2: The time-varying function b(t) is away from zero,
without losing generality, we assume that b(t) > 0 and there exists
an unknown b such that 0 < b ≤ |b(x, t)| < ∞ for all x ∈ R, t ∈
[0, +∞).
Remark 1: Assumption 2 is more general than the one used in [1],
since the latter requires that b be known.
Theorem 1: Under Assumptions 1-2, the closed-loop system consisting of (9) and the control law (10) is PT stable in the sense of
Definition 4 and all internal signals are bounded over [0, T ),
2
u = −k(µx) − θ(µx) ψ + |µ̇µ−2 (µx)|
(10)
where k > 0 and θ > 0.

According to Proposition 11, (13) results in V ∈ L∞ [0,pT ), and
hence z ∈ L∞ [0, T ). Furthermore, the state x = µ−1 2bV is
bounded and converges to zero as t → T . Since µ̇µ−2 = 1/T is
bounded, then Φ(x, t) is bounded, establishing the same for u(t).
Therefore, all signals are bounded, and the closed-loop system is PT
stable in the sense of Definition 4.

Remark 2: It is worth mentioning that, for system (9), as long
as b(x, t) satisfies b(x, t) ≥ b > 0 with b being some unknown
constant, the proposed PT control does not need a priori information
on b(x, t), such simple control algorithm without involving b can be
readily extended to higher-order systems in normal form [1]. Other
robust PT control results can be found in [9], [14], [26], [52] and the
references therein.
C. Adaptive prescribed-time control
It is interesting yet challenging to develop adaptive control schemes
to regulate the system state to zero in a prescribed time. So far,
the related results in this area are very limited. The following
subsections present three basic frameworks of adaptive PT control
through a scalar system: (Section III-C1) adaptive design for systems
with time-invariant parameters; (Section III-C2) adaptive design for
systems with time-varying parameters; and (Section III-C3) adaptive
Nussbaum gain design for systems with time-varying parameters.
We use time scaling method to develop our adaptive control design
and hence it is necessary to restate some basic concepts: i) x̆(τ ) =
˙ ) = ẋ(t); and iii) α(τ ) > 0.
x(t); ii) α(τ )x̆(τ
1) Design for systems with time-invariant parameters:
Assumption 3 ([27]): The nonlinearity f (x, t) can be parameterized
as f (x, t) = θψ(x) with ψ(x) being a known smooth function and
ψ(0) = 0, and θ being an unknown constant.

, otherwise, by ×.

Assumption 4 ([97]): The function b(x, t), called control coefficient, satisfies b(x, t) ≡ b with b being an unknown nonzero constant.
The sign of b is available for control design. Furthermore, we assume
that there exists a known constant b satisfies b < b.
Since ψ ∈ C 1 and ψ(0) = 0, then by Hadamard’s Lemma, we
know that there exists a known smooth mapping ψ̄ such that ψ = ψ̄x.
Theorem 2: Under Assumptions 3-4, the closed-loop system consisting of (9) and the adaptive control law (14) is PT stable in the
sense of Definition 3 and all internal signals are bounded over [0, T ),

Lemma that limτ →∞ x̆(τ ) = 0 (i.e., limt→T x(t) = 0). Furthermore,
according to (14) and Assumption 3 we know that there exists a
number L such that |dθ̂(τ )/dτ | ≤ Lx̆2 , and hence dθ̂(τ )/dτ ∈ L1 .
In view of the argument of Theorem 3.1 in [99], it follows that θ̂(τ )
has a limit as τ → ∞. Similarly, one can conclude that ρ̂(τ ) has
˙
a limit as τ → ∞. In addition, it follows from (14) that4 ρ̂(t)

γρ sgn(b)xū = γρ sgn(b)(ka′ (t) + θ̂2 /2 + ψ̄ 2 /2)x2 ≥ 0 for ∀b > 0
˙
and ρ̂(t)
≤ 0 for ∀b < 0. Therefore, one can conclude that ρ̂ ≥ 0
if we choose ρ̂(0) > 0 when b > 0, and that ρ̂ ≤ 0 if we choose
ρ̂(0) < 0 when b < 0, which also yields ρ̂(t)b > 0. Such conclusion
is useful for choosing a suitable control gain k, as seen shortly.
To proceed, we rewrite the closed-loop dynamics as

4 It is important to ensure that xū ≤ 0 since this guarantees the monotonicity of ρ̂(t) and thus allows to explicitly pick a suitable control gain k.

In terms of Lemma 1, we obtain that the control input u(t) is bounded
over [0, T ) and limt→T u(t) = 0. Therefore, the closed-loop system
is PT stable in the sense of Definition 3.
N
Remark 3: Since |ρ̂(t)| is a monotone increasing function and bρ̂ >
0, then kmin = ρ̂(0)b. Therefore, we only need to pick k > 1/(ρ̂(0)b)
to ensure that kmin > 1. Particularly, when the control coefficient b
is known, as assumed in [27], there is no need for using Lemma 1,
we just need to choose k > 1.
2) Design for systems with time-varying parameters:
Assumption 5: The nonlinearity f (x, t) satisfies that f (x, t) =
θ(t)ψ(x), where ψ(x) is a known smooth function, ψ(0) = 0, and
the time-varying parameter θ(t) takes values in an unknown compact
set, i.e., there exists an unknown constant δθ such that |θ(t)| ≤ δθ .
Remark 4: Such Assumption is more general than the one used in
[27], since the latter requires that θ(t) be time-invariant. It is also
more general than the Assumption used in [96] because the latter
requires that δθ be known.
Theorem 3: Under Assumptions 4-5, the closed-loop system consisting of (9) and the adaptive control law (25) is PT stable in the
sense of Definition 3 and all internal signals are bounded over [0, T ),

Assumption 6: The function b(x, t), called control coefficient, is
away from zero and takes values in a compact set. However, its
magnitude and sign are unknown. There exists a known positive
constant b satisfies b ≤ |b(x, t)|.
Lemma 2 ([98]): Consider two C ∞ positive functions V (t) :
[0, ∞) 7→ R+ and N (t) : [0, ∞) 7→ R+ . Let b(t) : [0, ∞) 7→ [b, b̄]

˙
ξ̇(t) ≥ 0,
V̇ (t) ≤ (b(t)N (ξ) + 1)ξ(t),

the fundamental idea and the key design steps are worth extending
to more general systems. In addition, since neural network (NN) can
be combined with robust adaptive to deal with modeling uncertainties,
how to compensate the NN reconstruction error to get PT stability
represents an increasing topic for future study.

guaranteed by the boundedness of ξ. Therefore, it can be concluded
that x̆˙ ∈ L∞ , which further indicates that limτ →∞ x̆(τ ) = 0 via
Barbalat’s Lemma. In addition, in terms of the analysis similar to
that in the proof of Theorem 2, the boundedness of all closed-loop
signals can be guaranteed and hence the closed-loop system is PT
stable in the sense of Definition 3.
N
Remark 5: It is noted that the adaptive PT control is developed
for the system with unknown yet time-varying parameters in both
feedback and input channels. These parameters are not slowly timevarying, but rather, are fast time-varying or even involve abrupt
changes, thereby making the controller design quite challenging.
Although the control algorithm is based on the first-order system,

PT control for MIMO nonlinear systems is an open area of research that is both theoretically and practically important and urgent,
especially with new problems arising from emerging applications
such as missile guidance, accurate and timely weather forecasting,
aircraft and spacecraft flight control, and obstacle avoidance in
robotic systems, all of which require new control technologies for
time optimization. There have been few research on PT control
for MIMO nonlinear systems, particularly when the control gain
matrix is unknown, and essentially no findings that can provide PT
stabilization, regulation, or tracking. In [94], by using time based
generators, a PT control algorithm is applied to a 7-DoF robot
manipulator with a precondition that all information in the control
gain matrix is available. In [21], a parametric Lyapunov function
based PT controller is applied to a spacecraft rendezvous control
system, where the mathematical model of such system can be viewed
as a MIMO linear system. In [18], a PT regulation method is
developed for the Euler-Lagrange system with known inertia matrix.
In [52], PT tracking control for MIMO systems with unknown control
gain matrix and non-vanishing uncertainties are studied. In addition,
some other studies consider the practical PT tracking control (see, for
instance, [100]), whose basic idea is to introduce a smooth function
that can converge to a given value at the prescribed time, and to
convert the original constrained system into an unconstrained one
by using the idea of coordinate transformation similar to that in the
prescribed performance control theory [101], and finally to obtain
the tracking error of the original system that can converge to a given
accuracy at the prescribed time by proving the boundedness of the
converted system. In the following sections, we introduce a powerful
design approach for MIMO system that applies not only to square
systems but also to non-square systems.

A. Square system
Consider a MIMO nonlinear system as follows:
Ẋ = B(X, t)U + F (X, t)

(36)

where U ∈ Rn and X ∈ Rn are the input and the state vector,
respectively. F (X, t) = [f1 , · · · , fn ]⊤ ∈ Rn denotes the modeling
uncertainties and external perturbations and each fi satisfies Assumption 1, i.e., kF k ≤ d(t)Ψ with Ψ = [ψ1 , · · · , ψn ]⊤ ∈ Rn .
Assumption 7 ([52]): The matrix B(X, t) ∈ Rn×n is square and
unknown. The only information available for control design is that
(B + B⊤ ) is positive definite and symmetric.
Theorem 5: Under Assumptions 1 and 7, the closed-loop system
consisting of (36) and the control law (37) is PT stable in the sense
of Definition 4 and all internal signals are bounded over the time
interval [0, T ),
U = −kZ − θZkΦk2
X
where k > 0, θ > 0, Z = TT−t
, and Φ = Ψ + µ̇µ−2 kZk.

V. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN P RESCRIBED - TIME CONTROL
In this section, we aim to present a literature survey of the
foundations of PT decentralized control theory. Knowledge of graph
theory can be found in any of the papers about multi-agents, which
we have omitted here due to space constraints.
The idea of using time-varying feedback to obtain PT stability has
already appeared in early distributed control and has accomplished a
large diffusion in recent years. For example, PT consensus on single
and double integrator dynamics cases [38], [92]; PT consensus under
undirected/directed graph and PT containment under multiple leaders
of first-order networked multi-agent systems [39]; leader-following
control of high-order multi-agent systems [40]; PT consensus via time
base generator [41]; cluster synchronization of complex networks
[43]; lag consensus of second order leader-following multi-agents
[44]; PT consensus observer for high-order multi-agents [46]; PT
bipartite consensus tracking [42], [45]; PT consensus over timevarying graph via time scaling [47], and then generalized in [48]–[51],
in which, PT formation tracking, leader-following control, uncertain
multi-agent dynamics, multi-agent rigid body system, are considered.
A. Prescribed-time consensus protocol
Consider a multi-agent system where the dynamics of each subagent is a single integrator:
ẋi = ui ,

i = 1, 2, · · · , n.

(44)

The general consensus protocol is:
B. Non-Square system
Now we consider a non-square MIMO system Ẋ = BU + F
satisfying the following Assumption:
Assumption 8 ([52]): The high frequency gain matrix B(X, t) ∈
Rn×m can be characterized as B(X, t) = A(X, t)M(X, t), where
M ∈ Rm×m is uncertain yet possibly asymmetric and A ∈ Rn×m is
a known matrix with full row rank. The message usable for synthesis
is that A(M + M⊤ )A⊤ is symmetric and positive definite.
Under Assumption 8, we get a new MIMO system as follows
Ẋ = AMU + F (X, t)

(42)

where U ∈ Rm and X ∈ Rn are the input and the state vector,
respectively.
According to Assumption 7, we known that the positive definiteness of (B + B⊤ ) ensures that λmin (B + B⊤ ) is always positive
and there exists some positive unknown constant wA , such that
1
0 < wA ≤ kAk
λmin (A(M + M⊤ )A⊤ ).
Theorem 6: Under Assumptions 1 and 8, the closed-loop system
consisting of (36) and the control law (43) is PT stable in the sense
of Definition 4 and all internal signals are bounded over [0, T ),

where 0 ≤ αij ≤ 1 and k > 0. Obviously, protocol (45) covers
several common cases:
• when αij = 1, it simplifies to the classical asymptotic consensus
protocol studied in [102]; then the original system can be
abbreviated as ẋ = −Lx, where x = [x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ]⊤ ∈ Rn
and L is the Laplace matrix of the system, and L = [lik ]n×n ,
 P

Meanwhile, the Laplace matrix L has only one zero eigenvalue
and all other eigenvalues with positive real parts if and only
if the corresponding directed graph G contains a spanning tree
[103].
• when αij = 0, it corresponds to the discontinuous FT consensus
protocol outlined in [104].
• when 0 < αij < 1, it reduces to the continuous however
nonsmooth FT consensus protocol established in [105].
It is important to note that with 0 < αij < 1, the finite settling
1−α
(0)
time T is determined by Proposition 1 as T = Vc(1−α)
with c > 0
being some constant associated with the design parameters k, αij ,
and λ2 (L)5 (which relies on the structure of G). There are several
issues associated with the settling time T :
• The settling time T is affected by design parameters k and αij ,
the initial state V (0), as well as the topological structure.
• To produce a lower T , one can increase k or decrease αij
(creating a larger c or a smaller α), but the control effort
increases with a smaller αij .
5 λ (L) denotes the i-th minimum eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix L.

•

If a settling time T is imposed, it is necessary to try to
find the relevant parameters c and α based upon V (0) from
Proposition 1, which cannot be explicitly pre-set because αij is
implicitly involved in the function and the initial condition may
be unknown.

The following PT consensus protocol circumvents all the aforementioned shortcomings [39]:

j∈Ni aij (xi − xj ) is the local neighborhood error, and µ(t) is
well defined on [0, T ) as in (8).
Theorem 7: Consider system (44) in conjunction with the protocol
(47). If the the graph G is undirected and connected, and the design
parameter c is selected as c ≥ 1/λ2 (L), then the consensus is attained
in prescribed-time, namely

Furthermore, the control input remain C smooth and bounded over
[0, T ).

B. Prescribed-time containment protocol
When the communication topology structure involves multiple
leaders, the containment control can be naturally evolved from the
consensus control. In this subsection, the achieved consensus result
is extended to the scenario of containment.
Theorem 8: Consider system (44) in conjunction with the protocol (47). If the graph G has a directed spanning tree leaded
by the root node xi , and the design parameter c is selected as
c ≥ 2λmax (P̃)/λ1 (Q̃), then, for ∀t ∈ [0, T ), the containment is
attained in prescribed-time, namely

VI. C OMPARISON AND CONCLUSION
To close this article, we recap the connection between the PT
results to FT results, and discuss the related numerical implementation issues. In addition, we compare the differences between typical
FT/FxT/PdT and PT controllers via simulation on a double integrator.
Finally, we conclude by giving some future research challenges.

A. Controller structure
Consider the first-order integrator as follows:
ẋ = u,

x(0) = x0

(49)

From [21], one can immediately obtain a time-varying feedback based
PT controller as
kx
uprescribed = −
, k ≥ 1.
(50)
T −t
Also, from [57], we get the classical FT autonomous controller as
ufinite = −k sgn(x)|x|α , 0 < α < 1, k > 0,

(51)

then the solution of (49) with (51) is
(
 1
x(t) = |x0 |1−α − k(1 − α)t 1−α sgn(x0 ), t ∈ [0, Tf )
x(t) = 0,
t ∈ [Tf , +∞)
with
Tf =

1
1
|x0 |1−α .
k (1 − α)

Therefore, we have |x0 |1−α = kTf (1 − α), and the control law (51)
can be rewritten as
ufinite = − k sgn(x)|x|α−1 |x|
=−k
=−

 1 α−1
|x0 |1−α − k(1 − α)t 1−α
x

(52)

.
(1 − α)(Tf − t)

Note that if we choose k ≡ 1−α
, the PT controller (50) becomes the
FT controller (51), which means that the FT controller (51) is indeed
a special case of the PT controller (50). In fact, they share the same
property that the control gain tends to ∞ as t → T . As a matter of
fact, all FT controllers (including FxT controllers, PT controllers, and
PdT controllers) share this property. Also note that the magnitude of
the PT control input (50) (consisting of a high-gain function − T k−t
and a feedback signal x) does not become large when the feedback
signal decays faster than the high-gain function grows.

B. Discussion on Implementation
In the implementation of FT control algorithms, it is necessary to
introduce sign function sgn(x) to avoid singularity when x(t) = 0.
For example, the control law u = −x1/3 is programmed to be replaced by u = − sgn(x)|x|1/3 . Two effective ways of implementing
PTC are:
• Letting T = Ts (scheduled time) +ǫ (small constant) so that the
controller works for the scheduled time;
• Setting an upper bound on the scaling function µ(t) before the
time variable approaches the desired preset time T .
Anyhow, unbounded control gain will not cause unbounded control
input, and many simulation results show that the PT regulation is
achieved with a suitable control effort, without an exorbitant price.
Both of the above implement methods slightly sacrifice the control
precision in favor of promoting practical implementation by avoiding
unbounded gains. The major concern for time-varying feedback
control is its robustness against measurement noise.
To show the characteristics and the differences of FT, FxT, PdT and
PT control schemes, we consider a double integrator for numerical
simulation. The system model is a double integrator as follows:
ẋ1 = x2 ,

ẋ2 = u.

(53)

The FT controller [57, Example 1], the FxT controller [73, Example
5.11], the PdT controller [80, Example 4.2], and the PT controller
[27] are shown below:

Two scenarios are considered for simulation: x1 (0) = 0.2 and
0.4 and x2 (0) = −0.2 and 0. Figs. 3-6 illustrate the simulation
results, from which, it can be seen that the PT controller achieves FT
regulation in T = 1s, whereas the settling time of the FT controller
depends on the initial conditions, the FxT controller depends on
the design parameters and the upper bound on the settling time is
overestimated, and the PdT controller requires a larger control input
when the initial conditions become slightly larger, and a slighter
overestimation of the settling time can be observed. Besides, from
Figs. 3-6, it is observed that the PT controller exhibits smoother
control action, avoiding the chatting phenomenon as reflected in Figs.
3-5. These simulation results show to some extent the superiority of
PT control compared to the other three control methods.

The core idea in PT control is to design a suitable time-varying
gain that goes to ∞ as the system converges to zero, which is
derived from proportional navigation in strategic and tactical missile
guidance applications. In PT control, we require more than that, not
only to regulate the state precisely to zero but also to ensure that
the control signal is bounded, while completely rejecting external
disturbance. The potential topics on PT control for complex dynamic
plants include (but not limited to):
• Although adaptive PT control is investigated in [27], the system
unknown parameter must remain unchanged , while the control
coefficient must be accessible. In some modern practical applications (such as high-performance robots [106]–[108]), such
assumptions may not be satisfied since we know that systems
with changing structures usually have time-varying system parameters and that the inertia matrix (which can be viewed as the
control influence gain) of a robotic system is usually unknown. It
is necessary and challenging to develop more powerful solutions
to meet such scenarios.
• Output feedback schemes often imply low cost, which is
very attractive in practical applications (especially for largescaled/networked/multi-agent systems). However, the existing
results can only achieve output feedback PT stabilizing control
for some special systems (e.g., linear systems), it is therefore
important to explore the output feedback based PT control for
more general systems.
• In addition to the PT stabilizing control, the study of the PT
tracking control is more general, however, when tracking is
considered, the desired trajectory to be tracked would give rise
to extra time variation and/or uncertainties and hence brings
technical obstacles. How to improve the PT control algorithm
so that it completely rejects these non-vanishing uncertainties
(which may be generated by the desired tracking signal, may
come from some external noise, or may be inherent in the
physical model) is an interesting future research topic.
• As for PT control for multi-agent systems, it is interesting to
generalize the simple framework on first or second-order integrators to agents having high-order uncertain nonlinear dynamics
and to investigate PT decentralized control algorithms under
complex communication topologies, as well as to study how to
achieve consensus with as little information interaction between
agents as possible without losing controllability.
• The study of more types of system models, more lowconservative control algorithms or the pursuing for better control
performance of closed-loop systems are all interesting future
research topics in the field of PT control.
