**PAPER TITLE:** REBEL: Reinforcement Learning via Regressing Relative Rewards

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** REBEL is a reinforcement learning algorithm that reduces the problem of RL to solving a sequence of relative reward regression problems on iteratively collected datasets. The algorithm uses a simple square loss regression problem to predict the difference in rewards between two completions of a prompt, allowing it to eliminate the complexity of using value functions and clipping updates.

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* REBEL is a simple and scalable RL algorithm that can be applied to both language modeling and image generation tasks.
* The algorithm is able to match or outperform the performance of more complex RL algorithms like PPO and DPO.
* REBEL can be easily extended to handle intransitive preferences and incorporate offline data.
* The algorithm has strong theoretical guarantees, including a fast 1/T convergence rate and conservativity.
* REBEL is able to learn from human feedback and improve the performance of language models and image generation models.
