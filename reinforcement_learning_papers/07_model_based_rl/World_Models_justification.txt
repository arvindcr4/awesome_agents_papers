Abstract Snippet:
World Models David Ha 1 Jürgen Schmidhuber 2 3  arXiv:1803.10122v4 [cs.LG] 9 May 2018  Abstract We explore building generative neural network models of popular reinforcement learning environments. Our world model can be trained quickly in an unsupervised manner to learn a compressed spatial and temporal representation of the environment. By using features extracted from the world model as inputs to an agent, we can train a very compact and simple policy that can solve the required task. We can even train our agent entirely inside of its own hallucinated dream generated by its world model, and...
