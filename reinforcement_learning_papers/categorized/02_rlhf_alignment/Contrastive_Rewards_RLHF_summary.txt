**TITLE:** Improving Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Using Contrastive Rewards
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The authors propose a simple fix to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) that leads to substantial performance improvements. They introduce contrastive rewards, which involve offline sampling to obtain baseline responses and using them to define a contrastive reward. This reward is then used in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) stage to guide the learning process.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The authors introduce contrastive rewards as a novel approach to improve RLHF-based alignment.
* They propose a simple and efficient method to implement contrastive rewards in RLHF, which involves offline sampling and using the sampled baseline responses to define a contrastive reward.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through analytical insights and extensive empirical testing, showing that it consistently outperforms the PPO algorithm with a margin of approximately 20% across various tasks evaluated by human annotators.
* They also show that their approach improves the robustness of the RLHF pipeline given the imperfections of the reward model, and reduces variance in PPO.
* The authors provide a detailed analysis of the benefits of the contrastive reward term, including its ability to penalize uncertain instances, improve robustness, encourage improvement over baselines, and calibrate according to task difficulty.
