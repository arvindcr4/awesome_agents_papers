**PAPER**: Multi-Agent Connected Autonomous Driving using Deep Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE**: Multi-Agent Connected Autonomous Driving using Deep Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID**: 1911.04175v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a multi-agent connected autonomous driving framework using deep reinforcement learning. The authors model the driving environment as a Partially Observable Markov Game (POSG) and provide a taxonomy of multi-agent learning environments. They also introduce MACAD-Gym, a multi-agent connected autonomous driving platform, and MACAD-Agents, a set of baseline agents for training.
