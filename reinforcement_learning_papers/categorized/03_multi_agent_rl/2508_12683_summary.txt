**TITLE:** A Taxonomy of Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems: Design Patterns, Coordination Mechanisms, and Industrial Applications
**ARXIV_ID:** 2508.12683v1 [cs.MA]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a taxonomy for hierarchical multi-agent systems (HMAS) and explores its applications in various domains, including energy management, oil and gas operations, warehouse logistics, and human-agent collaboration. The taxonomy categorizes HMAS along five key axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation, temporal layering, and communication structure.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a comprehensive taxonomy for HMAS
* Explores the applications of HMAS in various domains, including energy management, oil and gas operations, warehouse logistics, and human-agent collaboration
* Discusses the challenges and future directions of HMAS, including trust, accountability, scalability, and integration with learning agents and large language models.
