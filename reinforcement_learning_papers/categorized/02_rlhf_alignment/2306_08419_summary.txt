**PAPER:** Mediated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Mediated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2306.08419v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by introducing a mediator that can act on behalf of a subset of agents. The mediator is trained to maximize social welfare while ensuring that the agents' incentives are aligned with the mediator's actions. The approach is based on the concept of mechanism design, which studies how to implement trusted entities that interact with self-interested agents to achieve desirable social outcomes.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces the concept of mediators in MARL to promote conditional cooperation
* Proposes a constrained objective for the mediator to maximize social welfare while ensuring incentive compatibility
* Develops a practical implementation of the mediator using actor-critic frameworks and dual gradient descent
* Evaluates the approach in various matrix and iterative games, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting cooperation and improving social welfare.
