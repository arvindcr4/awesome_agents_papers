The phenomenon of spontaneous emission can lead to the creation of an imaginary coupling and
a shift. To explore this, we utilized the renormalized first Nikitin model, revealing an exponential
detuning variation with a phase and an imaginary coupling along with the shift. By employing
the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, we investigated the behavior of our system. Our findings
indicate that the imaginary coupling provides specific information, while the shift generates allowed
and forbidden zones in the energy diagram of the real part of the energy. In the diagram of the
imaginary part of the energy, time dictates order or chaos in the system and identifies the information
transmission zone. Notably, the first Nikitin model exhibits similarities to the Rabi model in the
short-time approximation. Our theoretical conclusions are consistent with numerical solutions.

INTRODUCTION

The concept of spontaneous emission underpins many
physical phenomena, such as non-Hermiticity [1–10], dissipation [11–20] between quantum systems, the production of lasers [21–30], and various other natural occurrences. Non-Hermiticity has become a focal topic of
scientific discussion worldwide and has garnered significant attention in the field of quantum mechanics. In
some cases, spontaneous emission and non-Hermiticity
are interrelated. For instance, [31] demonstrated that
excessive spontaneous emission in a laser oscillator increases noise in non-Hermitian optical systems. Furthermore, [32] confirmed spontaneous emission at exceptional
points through photoluminescence measurements, while
[33] developed a general theory of spontaneous emission,
highlighting its applicability to dispersive media.
Several authors suggest that the chirality of nonHermitian models, such as the SSH (Su-SchriefferHeeger) model [34], generates a complex Berry phase, explaining the presence of gapless edge modes. Yuto Ashida
et al. [35] explored the topology of non-Hermitian systems, introducing the concept of band topology in complex spectra and defining their classifications. Another
study [36] showed that spontaneous decay induces quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems, revealing a connection between dissipation and non-Hermitian
properties in quantum systems. Non-Hermitian systems are characterized by complex eigenenergies comprising real and imaginary components. This notion can
be counterintuitive because quantum mechanics dictates
that a system must be Hermitian, with real eigenenergies,
to measure observables.
In studying the interaction between a two-level system
and its environment, we propose a new scenario where
spontaneous emission generates imaginary coupling, as
illustrated in Fig.1 accompanied by a static shift. In
this context, we consider two quantum states, denoted
as |1⟩ and |2⟩, represented respectively by positive detuning Ω (t) and negative detuning −Ω (t). These states
are coupled via an imaginary term i∆ and the static shift.

FIG. 1. Spontaneous emission between two diabatic states
during their interaction. In this process, the states |1⟩ and
|2⟩ are associated with the detuning Ω (t) and −Ω (t) Injection of the magnetic field is at the origin of the creation of
spontaneous emission characterized by an imaginary coupling
followed by a shift. This reflects the non-hermitian character
of our Hamiltonian
.

To investigate the dynamics of this scenario, we selected the exponential Nikitin model, characterized by
exponentially varying detuning, imaginary coupling, and
a static shift term. The imaginary term primarily drives
the non-Hermitian nature of our Hamiltonian. While
quantum mechanics generally permits the measurement
of observables only when the spectrum is real, this work
examines how complex spectra emerge when coupling becomes complex. The Nikitin model has been extensively
explored in previous works, such as those by Nesbitt et
al. [37] and Vitanov [38], who highlighted its similarity to
the Demkov-Kunike model under strong coupling. The
Nikitin model also describes decay processes [39] and has
applications in interferometry [40]. Furthermore, collision dynamics between two states have been described
using an exponential model by V. Sidis et al. [41].
In this work, we present a novel perspective on sponta-

2
neous emission, incorporating imaginary coupling with a
shift in the off-diagonal Hamiltonian terms. Spontaneous
emission plays a crucial role in Bose-Einstein condensates [42–53], radio-active process [54–63] and ultra-cold
trapped gas [64–74]. Our aim is to construct a theoretical framework to better understand this model’s behavior
and elucidate the role of imaginary coupling.
This paper is organized as follows: in the first section,
we present the exponential Nikitin model. In the second
section, we solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to analyze the model’s dynamics. In the third section, we discuss the energy spectrum. Finally, we summarize our findings and propose future research directions.

I.

EXPONENTIAL MODEL

To describe the interaction between diabatic states |1⟩
and |2⟩ during spontaneous emission, we select the first
exponential Nikitin model due to its exponentially varying parameters.
Our model is described by the Hamiltonian:
H (t) = Ω (t) σz + δσx ,

δ=

1
(i∆ + ϵ) .
2

(1.2)

(1.3)

As shown, the detuning Ω (t) varies exponentially, as
observed in [39], but with the additional feature of a
phase β. Here, A represents the amplitude, responsible
for the signal strength; α is the sweep velocity induced by
an external field; and β is the phase, which controls oscillations’ increase or decrease. The coupling δ includes an
imaginary component due to the effects of spontaneous
emission, accompanied by a shift ϵ. At this stage, the
shift acts as the real coupling responsible for the interaction between the levels. The Pauli matrices σω with
ω = x, y, z are defined as the generators of the SU (2) Lie
algebra describing the dynamics of the two-level system.
Compared to the work of [39], which studied the
Nikitin model with real detuning and coupling in the context of decay, this work focuses on spontaneous emission
with imaginary coupling. The combination of imaginary
coupling and the shift introduces nonlinearity to our system.

METHODS

Among the various methods available to study the dynamics of this model-such as the Bloch picture [75, 76]
with the Lindbard equation [77] , the Feymann Path
integral [78], the Schrödinger picture with the timedependent Schrödinger [39], and so on. we chose the
Schrödinger picture. This method provides a wealth of
information, including probability amplitudes, the propagator, and the transition probabilities.
A.

Schrödinger picture

The dynamics of our model are determined using the
time-dependent Schrödinger equation, which establishes
the relationship between probabilities and their evolution through the matrix elements of the propagator. The
non-Hermitian nature of our system arises from the effects of spontaneous emission, introducing an imaginary
coupling. The Schrödinger equation is expressed as:
i

(1.1)

where Ω (t) and δ represent, respectively, the detuning
and the Rabi frequency. Each parameter plays a crucial
role in describing the model. The detuning Ω (t) determines the direction of the magnetic field via the Pauli matrix σz , while the Rabi frequency measures the coupling
strength in the transverse direction σx . These quantities
are defined as follows:
1
Ω (t) = (A exp (αt + β) + ϵ) ,

transformation ψ1 (x) = xµ z (x). This reformulates the

Interpretation of the results

Figures 2, 3, and 4, describe the evolution of the
ground and excited-state populations during spontaneous
emission.
In Fig. 2, we observe the evolution of the first Nikitin
model for the ground and excited-state populations as a
function of time when the coupling and the shift vary.
Regarding the excited-state population, when ∆ > 0 and
ϵ > 0 the system demonstrates an increase in oscillations with a weak amplitude, as shown in panel (a1 ).
Conversely, when ∆ < 0 and ϵ < 0, as depicted in panel
(a3 ), the system also oscillates, but its amplitude doubles.
This indicates that the imaginary coupling and the shift
enhance information transfer at low values. When ∆ = 0
and ϵ ̸= 0 in panel (a5 ), oscillations occur with very low
amplitude due to the absence of coupling. In the groundstate population, oscillations decrease whether the imaginary coupling increases (a2 ) or decreases (a4 ), implying
that this parameter does not significantly influence population evolution. However, when ∆ = 0 and ϵ ̸= 0, the
oscillations increase, and transmission is maximal when
the imaginary part of the coupling vanishes.
In Fig. 3, we plot the evolution of the different populations against the coupling when the phase β and the shift
ϵ vary. In both the ground and excited states, the two
populations exhibit exponential decay due to the absence
of oscillations. This decay is less pronounced in panels
(a1 ), (a2 ), (a3 ), (a5 ). However, in panels (a4 )and(a6 ), the
decay is more pronounced due to the high values of the
shift in the ground-state population. In this case, the
population exceeds one, an effect attributed to the high
phase. Therefore, the shift and phase are responsible for
the rapid decay of the population in this scenario.
Figure 4 illustrates the variation of the previous states
versus the shift ϵ as the phase varies. In panels (c2 ), (c4 )
and (c6 ) the population decreases exponentially. In contrast, panels (c1 ), (c3 ) and (c5 ) exhibit slight oscillations
due to the high value of the phase β in the excited-state
population. This implies that the phase β is critical for
the potential transmission of information in the groundstate population.

In Fig.5, the color bar Re(E− )) and Re(E+ )) illustrates the evolution of eigenenergies for the ground and

zone for specific information. When ϵ ⩽ 2, the system
creates a barrier (white color) that prevents information
transmission near zero on the coupling axis (panels (a1 )
and (a2 )). When ϵ > 2, the system generates a barrier
(blue color) that allows information transmission in the
same zone. Both phenomena occur over a long phase
duration.
Figure 6 shows the imaginary part of the energy as a
function of the phase and coupling. The color bar depicts
the variation in imaginary coupling for the ground (a1 )
and excited states (a2 ). The transmission of information
is localized (between −30/α and −10/α) due to information loss. The sweep velocity and amplitude influence
order or chaos in the system for high values. The imaginary part describes the system’s quantum information
loss.

The first exponential Nikitin model shows similarities
with the Rabi model when time approaches −∞ in an exponential function. Under these conditions, the detuning
becomes Ω (t) = ϵ, while the coupling remains a complex
function i∆ + ϵ. To study the dynamics of this model,
we again use the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

In Fig.7, we plot the variation of the population as a
function of time. In frame (a), the interferogram of the
population shows the presence of multiple waves around
a mirror at ϵ = 0, which reflects them in the opposite
direction. These waves are generated by the small values
of the coupling, leading us to conclude that the coupling
is responsible for the interferometry observed in the system. Interferometry allows the extraction of significant
information about the system.

CONCLUSION

We have presented the first exponential Nikitin model
under the influence of spontaneous emission. This emission is accounted for by the presence of an imaginary coupling combined with a shift. The inclusion of the imaginary coupling introduces nonlinearity into the system’s
evolution and contributes to its non-Hermitian nature.
To study the dynamics of this model, we determined the
transition and survival probabilities as functions of time,
coupling, and shift.
When the population varies with time, as shown in
Fig.2, we observed that the imaginary coupling and the
shift enhance the transmission of information for small
values in the ground-state population. Conversely, these
parameters have no significant influence on the excitedstate population. When populations vary with the coupling, as illustrated in Fig.3, both ground and excited
states exhibit exponential decay. Rapid decay occurs
only when the phase takes a high value. Similarly, Fig.4
demonstrates exponential decay in populations, but some
oscillations appear when the phase is large, indicating information transfer.
The non-Hermitian nature of our system results in
complex eigenenergies, which can be separated into real
and imaginary parts. The evolution of these eigenenergies indicates that energy gain is localized over a broad
region, represented by the real part of the energy. Meanwhile, information loss is confined to a smaller region,
represented by the imaginary part. Furthermore, the
imaginary part contributes significantly to the transmission of the Rabi population, creating a ”mirror” effect
that reflects waves and generates oscillations.

For future work, it would be interesting to analyze
spontaneous emission at different sweep velocities, utilizing both the Demkov-Kunike and the second Nikitin
model.
