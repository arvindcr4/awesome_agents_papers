Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "arXiv:1502.05477v5 [cs.LG] 20 Apr 2017  Trust Region Policy Optimization  John Schulman JOSCHU @ EECS ."
- "By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified procedure, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
