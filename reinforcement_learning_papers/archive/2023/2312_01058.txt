A BSTRACT
Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has gained wide attention in recent years and has
made progress in various fields. Specifically, cooperative MARL focuses on training a team of
agents to cooperatively achieve tasks that are difficult for a single agent to handle. It has shown
great potential in applications such as path planning, autonomous driving, active voltage control,
and dynamic algorithm configuration. One of the research focuses in the field of cooperative MARL
is how to improve the coordination efficiency of the system, while research work has mainly been
conducted in simple, static, and closed environment settings. To promote the application of artificial
intelligence in real-world, some research has begun to explore multi-agent coordination in open
environments. These works have made progress in exploring and researching the environments
where important factors might change. However, the mainstream work still lacks a comprehensive
review of the research direction. In this paper, starting from the concept of reinforcement learning,
we subsequently introduce multi-agent systems (MAS), cooperative MARL, typical methods, and
test environments. Then, we summarize the research work of cooperative MARL from closed to
open environments, extract multiple research directions, and introduce typical works. Finally, we
summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the current research, and look forward to the future
development direction and research problems in cooperative MARL in open environments.

Introduction

As a sub-branch of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) [1] is an effective method for solving sequential
decision-making problems. Compared to supervised learning and unsupervised learning, RL learns from interactions.
In the paradigm of RL, an agent interacts with the environment and continuously optimizes its policy based on the
rewards or penalties it receives from the environment. Due to its similarity to the way humans acquire knowledge,
RL is considered as one of the approaches to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [2]. Early work in RL
relied on handcrafted features input into linear models for value estimation and approximation, which performed
poorly in complex scenarios. In the past decade, deep RL has achieved remarkable achievements in various fields with
the flourishing development of deep learning [3]. For example, Deep Q-Network (DQN) [4] surpassed professional
human players in Atari video games. AlphaGo [5] defeated the world champion Go player, Lee Sedol. AlphaStar [6]
defeated top human professional players in the imperfect information real-time policy game StarCraft II. OpenAI
Five [7] performed well in the multiplayer real-time online game Dota 2. AI-Suphx [8] also achieved significant
results in multiplayer imperfect information Mahjong games. In addition, the application scope of RL has gradually
expanded from the games to various domains in real life, including industrial manufacturing, robotic control, logistics
management, defense and military affairs, intelligent transportation, and intelligent healthcare, greatly promoting the
development of artificial intelligence [9, 10]. For example, ChatGPT [11], which has recently received widespread
attention, also uses RL techniques for optimization. In recent years, under the trend of applying artificial intelligence
to scientific research (AI4Science) [12], RL has also shined in many fundamental scientific fields. For example,
DeepMind achieved nuclear fusion control [13] with the application of RL. AlphaTensor has also applied RL into
discovering matrix multiplication [14].

At the same time, many real-world problems are shown to be large-scale, complex, real-time, and uncertain. Formulating such problems as the single-agent system is inefficient and inconsistent with real conditions, while modeling them
as multi-agent systems (MAS) [15] problems is often more suitable. Furthermore, multi-agent coordination has been
applied into dealing with many complex problems, such as autonomous driving cars, intelligent warehousing systems,
and sensor networks. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) [16–18] provides strong support for modeling and
solving these problems. In MARL, a team of agents learns a joint cooperative policy to solve the tasks through interactions with the environment. Compared to traditional methods, the advantages of MARL lie in its ability to deal with
environmental uncertainty and learn to solve unknown tasks without requiring excessive domain knowledge. In recent
years, the combination of deep learning and MARL has produced fruitful results [19], and many algorithms have been
proposed and applied to solve complex tasks. However, MARL also brings new challenges. On the one hand, the
environment where the MAS exists is often partially observable, and the individual cannot obtain global information
from its local observations. This means that independently learning agents struggle to make optimal decisions [20].
On the other hand, since other agents are also learning simultaneously, the policies will change accordingly. From the
perspective of an individual agent, the environment is non-stationary, and convergence cannot be guaranteed [21]. In
addition, cooperative MAS often receive shared rewards only, and how to allocate these rewards to provide accurate
feedback for each agent (a.k.a, credit assignment), thereby enabling efficient learning of cooperation and ultimately
maximizing system performance, is one of the key challenges [22]. Finally, as the number of agents in a MAS increases, the search space faced in solving RL problems will exponentially expand, making policy learning and search
extremely difficult, bring the scalability issue. Therefore, organizing efficient policy learning is also a major challenge
at present [23, 24].
To address the aforementioned challenges, a large amount of work is currently being conducted from multiple aspects,
and surprising achievements have been made in many task scenarios [18]. Cooperative MARL has demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional methods in tasks such as path planning [25], active voltage control [26], and
dynamic algorithm configuration [27]. Researchers have designed many algorithms to promote cooperation among
agents, including policy gradient based methods such as MADDPG [28] and MAPPO [29], value based methods such
as VDN [30] and QMIX [31], and other methods that leverage the powerful expressive power of Transformers to
enhance coordination capabilities, such as MAT [32]. These methods have demonstrated excellent cooperation ability
in many tasks, such as SMAC [33], Hanabi, and GRF [29]. In addition to the above methods and their respective
variants, researchers have also conducted in-depth exploration and research on cooperative MARL from other perspectives, including alleviating partial observability under distributed policy execution settings through efficient communication [20], offline deployment of policies [34], world model learning in MARL [35], and research on training
paradigms [36].
Traditional machine learning research is typically conducted under the assumption of classical closed environments,
where crucial factors in the learning process remain constant. Nowadays, an increasing number of tasks, especially
those involving open environment scenarios, may experience changes in essential learning factors. Clearly, transitioning from classical to open environments poses a significant challenge for machine learning. For data-driven learning

3

tasks, data in open environments accumulates online over time, such as in the form of data streams, making model
learning more challenging. Machine learning in open environments [37, 38] has gained application prospects in many
scenarios, gradually attracting widespread attention. Current research in open environment machine learning includes
category changes, feature evolution, data distribution changes, and variations in learning objectives. Correspondingly,
some works in the field of RL have started focusing on tasks in open environments. Key areas of research include
trustworthy RL [39], environment generation and policy learning [40], continual RL [41], RL generalization capabilities [42], meta-RL [43], and sim-to-real policy transfer [44].
Compared to single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL), multi-agent scenarios are more complex and challenging. Currently, there is limited research on cooperative MASs in open environments, with some efforts focusing on
robustness in multi-agent settings [45]. These works describe problems and propose algorithmic designs from different perspectives [46–49]. Additionally, addressing the challenges of open-team MARL, some works introduce
settings such as Ad-Hoc Teamwork (AHT), Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC), and Few-Shot Teamwork (FST) to tackle
it [50–52]. Although these works have achieved success in some task scenarios, they still fail to align well with most
real-world applications, leaving room for substantial improvement in practical effectiveness. Regarding MARL, there
exist some review works, such as those on multi-agent systems [15], MARL [16,53–58], agent modeling in multi-agent
scenarios [59], non-stationarity handling in multi-agent settings [21], multi-agent transfer learning [60], cooperative
MARL [17, 61, 62], model-based multi-agent learning [35], causal MARL [63], and multi-agent communication [20].
Additionally, some works provide comprehensive analyses of open machine learning [37, 38, 64]. Although the mentioned works provide reviews and summaries in various aspects of MARL or open environment machine learning,
there is currently no systematic review specifically focusing on cooperative MARL in open environments. Considering the potential and value of cooperative MARL in solving complex coordination problems in real environments, this
paper aims to describe recent advances in this field. The subsequent arrangement of this paper is shown in Figure 1.
We first introduce the background relevant to this paper, including basic knowledge of RL, common knowledge and
background of MASs to MARL. Next, we introduce cooperative MARL in classical closed environments, covering
specific definitions, current mainstream research content, and common testing environments and application cases.
Following that, we introduce cooperative MARL in open environments, specifically including common research directions and content from closed machine learning and reinforcement learning to cooperative multi-agent scenarios.
Finally, we summarize the main content of this paper, provide a prospect on cooperative MARL in open environments,
and aim to inspire further research and exploration in this direction.

Background

2.1

Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning [1] aims to guide an agent to learn the appropriate actions based on the current state, i.e.,
learning a mapping from observed state to action, in order to maximize the cumulative numerical reward feedback
from the environment. The environment provides reward information based on the current state and the action taken
by the agent. The agent does not know the optimal actions in advance and must discover actions that yield the highest
cumulative reward through trial and error. In a standard RL scenario, the agent interacts with the environment by
observing states and taking actions. At each time step, the agent receives an observation of the current state, selects
an action based on that observation, and the execution will change the state of the environment and lead to a reward
signal. The goal of the agent is to execute a sequence of actions that maximizes the cumulative numerical reward.
2.1.1

Formulation of the problem

RL [1] is a sub-branch of machine learning that differs from classical supervised and unsupervised learning in that it
learns through interaction. In RL, an agent interacts with an environment, constantly optimizing its policy based on
the rewards or punishments received from the environment. RL consists of four main components: agent, state, action,
and reward (Figure 2). The goal of RL is to maximize cumulative rewards. The agent must explore and learn through
trial and error to find the optimal policy. This process can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Definition 1 (Markov Decision Process). A Markov Decision Process is defined by either the five-tuple ⟨S, A, P, R, γ⟩
(infinite process) or ⟨S, A, P, R, T ⟩ (finite process), where:
• S is the set of states,
• A is the set of actions,
• P : S × A × S → [0, 1] is the state transition probability function: P (s′ | s, a) = Pr[St+1 = s′ | St =
s, At = a],

• R : S × A → R is the reward function: R(s, a) = E[rt | St = s, At = a],
• γ ∈ [0, 1] is the discount factor, T is the maximum horizon.
The agent is free to choose deterministic action to perform in a given state or to sample actions from some certain
probability distributions. The emphasis here is on "free choice," which refers to the agent’s autonomy in changing
action selection. The fixed selection of actions is referred to as a "policy". Specifically, at any time step t, the agent
observes the current state st from the environment and then performs action at . This action causes the environment to
transition to a new state st+1 based on the transition function st+1 ∼ P (·|st , at ) and the agent receives a reward signal
rt = R(st , at ) from the environment. Without loss of generality, we mainly discusses infinite MDP in this paper,
where the goal of the agent is to find the optimal policy to maximize cumulative rewards. Mathematically, the above
process can be summarized as finding a Markov, time-independent, and stationary policy function π : S → ∆(A) that
guides the agent to execute appropriate sequential decisions to maximize cumulative rewards, with the optimization
objective defined as follows:
"∞
#

(1)

where the operator Eπ [·] computes the expectation over the distribution of sequences τ = (s0 , a0 , s1 , a1 , . . .) generated
by the policy π(at |st ) and the state transition P (st+1 |st , at ).
Based on the objective in Equation 1, the state-action value function, denoted as the Q-function, can be defined under
the guidance of policy π. The Q-function represents the expected cumulative reward after taking action a based on
state s under policy π. Additionally, the state value function V describes the expected cumulative reward based on
state s:

Clearly, the relationship between the state-action function Q and the state value function V can be expressed as
V π (s) = Ea∼π(·|s) [Qπ (s, a)] and Qπ (s, a) = Es′ ∼P (·|s,a) [R(s, a) + V π (s′ )]. Based on the definitions of these
two types of value functions, the learning goal of RL in Markov decision processes can be represented as finding the
optimal policy π∗ that maximizes the value function: π∗ = arg maxπ V π (s), ∀s.
2.1.2

Value based Reinforcement Learning

For the MDP with finite state and action space, there exists at least one deterministic stationary optimal policy that
maximizes the cumulative reward. Value based RL methods require the construction and estimation of a value function,
which is subsequently used to guide action selection and execution, deriving the corresponding policy. Most of these
algorithms do not directly use the V -function but require the use of the Q-value function to maximize the Q-value
corresponding to Equation 2. The optimal policy induced by the Q-function through greedy action selection can be
expressed as π ∗ (a|s) = 1{a = arg maxa Q∗ (s, a)}, where 1{·} is the indicator function. The classical Q-learning

5

algorithm, through temporal-difference (TD) learning, updates the agent’s function Q̂-value to approximate the optimal
function Q∗ [65], with the update process defined as follows:

(4)

To establish the optimal Q-value function, the Q-learning algorithm uses the fixed-point iteration of the Bellman equation to solve the unique solution for Q∗ (s, a) = (B ∗ Q∗ )(s, a). In practice, when the world model [67] is unknown,
state-action pairs are discretely represented, and all actions can be repetitively sampled in all states, the mentioned
Q-learning method guarantees convergence to the optimal solution.
However, real-world problems may involve continuous, high-dimensional state-action spaces, making the above assumptions usually inapplicable. In such cases, agents need to learn a parameterized Q-value function Q(s, a|θ), where
θ is the parameter instantiation of the function. To update the Q-function, the agent needs to collect samples generated
during interaction with the environment in the form of tuples (s, a, r, s′ ). Here, the reward r and the state s′ at the next
time step follow feedback from the environment based on the state-action pair (s, a). At each iteration, the current
Q-value function Q(s, a|θ) can be updated as follows [68]:
y Q = r + γ max
Q(s′ , a′ |θ),
′
a ∈A


θ ← θ + α y Q − Q(s, a|θ) ∇θ Q(s, a|θ),

(5)

where α is the update rate.
The Q-learning approach in Equation 5 can directly use a neural network Q(s, a|θ) to fit and converge to the optimal
Q∗ -value, where the parameters θ are updated through stochastic gradient descent (or other optimization methods).
However, due to the limited generalization and reasoning capabilities of neural networks, Q-networks may exhibit unpredictable variations in different locations of the state-action space. Consequently, the contraction mapping property
of the Bellman operator in Equation 4 is insufficient to guarantee convergence. Extensive experiments show that these
errors propagate with the propagation of online update rules, leading to slow or even unstable convergence. Another
disadvantage of using function approximation for Q-values is that, due to the action of the max operator, Q-values
are often overestimated. Therefore, due to the risks of instability and overestimation, special attention must be paid
to ensuring an appropriate learning rate. Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm proposed by literature [69] addresses
these challenges by incorporating two crucial factors: a target Q-network and experience replay buffer. Specifically,
DQN instantiates a target Q-network with parameters θ− to compute the temporal-difference target. Simultaneously,
it uses an experience replay buffer D to store sampled sequences, ensuring both sample utilization and, during training,
mitigating the correlation of sampled data through independent and identically distributed sampling. The optimization
objective of DQN can be expressed as:
min E(s,a,r,s′ )∼D [(r + γ max
Q(s′ , a′ |θ− ) − Q(s, a|θ))2 ],
′
θ

a ∈A

(6)

The target Q-network Q(s, a|θ− ) is periodically updated to synchronize with the parameters of the Q-network.
Through these methods and two crucial factors, stable training of the Q-network can be achieved.
Furthermore, many recent works have made additional improvements to DQN. In [70], the value function and advantage function (defined as A(s, a) = Q(s, a)−V (s)) are decoupled using a neural network structure, enhancing learning
performance. In [71], a specific update scheme (a variant of Equation 6) reduces the overestimation of Q-values while
improving learning stability. Parallel learning [72] or the use of unsupervised auxiliary tasks [73] contributes to faster
and more robust learning. In [74], a differentiable memory module can integrate recent experiences by interpolating
between Monte Carlo value estimates and off-policy estimates.

Policy Gradient based Reinforcement Learning

Policy gradient based methods [75] are fundamentally designed to directly learn a parameterized optimal policy πθ . In
comparison to value-based methods, policy-based algorithms have the following characteristics: firstly, these methods
can be flexibly applied to continuous action spaces; secondly, they can directly obtain a stochastic policy πθ (·|s).
When parameterizing the policy with a neural network, a typical approach is to adjust the parameters in the direction
of increasing the cumulative reward: θ ← θ + α∇θ V πθ (s). However, the gradient is also subject to the unknown
effects of policy changes on the state distribution. In [1], researchers derived a solution based on policy gradients that
does not involve the state distribution:
∇θ V πθ (s) = Es∼µπθ (·),a∼πθ (·|s) [∇θ log πθ (a|s) · Qπθ (s, a)] ,

(7)

where µπθ is the state occupancy measure under policy πθ [76], and ∇θ log πθ (a|s) is the policy’s score evaluation.
When the policy is deterministic, and the action space is continuous, we can further obtain the Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DPG) theorem [77]:


∇θ V πθ (s) = Es∼µπθ (·) ∇θ πθ (a|s) · ∇a Qπθ (s, a)|a=πθ (s) .
(8)
One of the most classical applications of policy gradients is the REINFORCE algorithm [78], which uses the cumulaPT
′
tive reward Rt = t′ =t γ t −t rt′ as an estimate for Qπθ (st , at ) to update the policy parameters.
2.1.4

Actor-Critic based Reinforcement Learning

The traditional Actor-Critic method consists of two components: the Actor, which adjusts the parameters θ of the
policy πθ ; and the Critic, which adjusts the parameters w of the state-action value function Qπwθ . Based on these two
components, the corresponding update methods for the Actor and Critic can be obtained as follows:
θ ←θ + αθ Qw (s, a)∇θ log πθ (s, a),
w ←w + αw (r + γQw (s′ , a′ ) − Qw (s, a))∇w Qw (s, a).

(9)

The Actor-Critic method combines policy gradient methods with value function approximation. The Actor probabilistically selects actions, while the Critic, based on the action chosen by the Actor and the current state, evaluates the
score of that action. The Actor then modifies the probability of choosing actions based on the Critic’s score. The
advantage of such methods is that they allow for single-step updates, yielding low-variance solutions in continuous
action spaces [79, 80]. However, the drawback is that, during the initial stages of learning, there is significant fluctuation due to the imprecise estimation by the Critic. Figure 3 illustrates the architecture of the Actor-Critic method, and
for more details on SARL methods, refer to the review [9].

Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
Multi-agent Systems

The Multi-agent system (MAS) evolved from Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) [81]. The research aim is to address real-world problems that are large-scale, complex, real-time, and involve uncertainty. Modeling such problems
with a single intelligent agent is often inefficient and contradictory to real-world conditions. MASs exhibit autonomy, distribution, coordination, self-organization, reasoning, and learning capabilities. Developed since the 1970s,
research on MASs encompasses both building individual agents’ technologies, such as modeling, reasoning, learning,
and planning, and technologies for coordinating the operation of multiple agents, such as interaction, coordination,
cooperation, negotiation, scheduling, and conflict resolution. MASs find rapid and extensive applications in areas
such as intelligent robotics, traffic control, distributed decision-making, software development, and gaming, becoming
a tool for analyzing and simulating complex systems [15].
Depending on task characteristics, MASs can generally be classified into three settings: Fully Cooperative, Fully
Competitive, and Mixed. In a Fully Cooperative setting, agents share a common goal, collaborating to accomplish
specific tasks, such as the assembly of machine systems. In a Fully Competitive setting, agents’ goals conflict, where
one agent’s gain results in another’s loss, like in a sumo wrestling match. Mixed settings involve agents forming
multiple groups, with cooperation within groups and competition between them, resembling a soccer match where
teammates cooperate while teams compete.
In MASs, different settings lead to variations in policy optimization goals and learned policies. In cooperative settings, agents must consider teammates’ policies, aiming for optimal coordination to avoid interference. In competitive
settings, agents consider opponents’ policies, minimizing opponents’ gains while maximizing their own returns, optimizing their policies accordingly.
2.2.2

Introduction to Game Theory

Game theory [82, 83], a mathematical theory and method for analyzing strategic interactions among rational agents,
was initially widely applied in economics and has expanded to cover various disciplines, including sociology, politics,
psychology, and computer science. In MASs, the interaction and decision-making processes among individuals can
be modeled as a game, providing a framework to analyze strategic choices. Game theory typically models problems
as normal-form games, defined as follows:
Definition 2 (Normal-form Games). A finite, n-player normal-form game consists of a triple (N , A, Q), where:
• N is a finite set of agents, with a size of n, each indexed by i ∈ 1, · · · , n;
• A = A1 × · · · × An represents the joint action space, where each Ai is the action set for agent i, and
a = (a1 , a2 , · · · , an ) ∈ A is called an action profile.
• Q = (Q1 , · · · , Qn ), where each component Qi : A 7→ R is the utility function of agent i.
Although game theory commonly uses the symbol u to denote the utility function, its meaning is equivalent to the
action-value function in the case of a single state and 1-horizon MDP. Hence, we replace u with the symbol Q for
consistency of notation. We also do not distinguish "policy" and "strategy" in the paper. For a two-player normal-form
game where both agents are in a fully competitive scenario, it can be modeled as a zero-sum game:

8

Definition 3 (Two-Player Zero-Sum Game). A game is a two-player zero-sum game when the utility functions satisfy
∀a, Q1 (a) + Q2 (a) ≡ 0.
In a normal-form game, if an agent takes a single action, it is considered a pure policy. When each agent takes a single
action, the resulting action profile a is known as a pure policy profile. More generally, an agent’s policy is defined as
follows:
Definition 4 (Policy and Policy Profile). In a normal-form game (N , A, Q), the policy of agent i is a probability
distribution defined on itsQ
feasible action space Ai , denoted as πi : Ai 7→ [0, 1]. The Cartesian product of all agents’
n
policies, denoted as π = i=1 πi , is a (mixed) policy profile.
The symbol πi , commonly used in RL, is employed here instead of the often-used symbol σi in game theory to
represent a probability distribution on the feasible action space. Additionally, in game theory, −i usually denotes
the set of all players except player i. Consequently, the expected utility of agent i under a mixed policy profile
π = (πi , π−i ) is given by
n
X
Y
Qi (πi , π−i ) =
Qi (a)
πi (ai ).
a∈A

i=1

The form of the expected utility shows that, for agent i, the expected utility functions of a two-person constant-sum
game and a two-player zero-sum game only differ by a constant c. Thus, under the same solution concept, there is
no difference in the policies between the two types of games. For rational agents, the goal is often to maximize their
utility, meaning maximizing their expected returns. Therefore, we need to introduce the definition of best response.
Definition 5 (Best Response). A policy πi⋆ for agent i is a best response to the policy profile π−i if
∀πi′ , Qi (πi⋆ , π−i) ≥ Qi (πi′ , π−i),
and the set of best responses to π−i is denoted as BR(π−i ).
The best response intuitively means that, given the policies of other agents π−i , the agent i’s policy πi⋆ maximizes its
utility. Thus, if other agents’ policies are fixed, we can use RL to find the best response. Based on best responses, we
can straightforwardly introduce the definition of Nash Equilibrium.
Definition 6 (Nash Equilibrium). In a game with n agents, if a policy profile π = (π1 , · · · , πn ) satisfies ∀i ∈
1, · · · , n, πi ∈ BR(π−i ), then π is a Nash Equilibrium.
According to the above definition, in a Nash Equilibrium, unilateral deviations by individual agents do not increase
their own utility, indicating that each rational agent has no incentive to deviate unilaterally from the equilibrium. Besides Nash Equilibrium, there are many other solution concepts in game theory, such as maximin policy and minimax
policy.
Definition 7 (Maxmin policy). The maxmin policy for agent i is arg maxπi minπ−i Qi (πi , π−i ), and its corresponding maxmin value is maxπi minπ−i ui (πi , π−i ).
The maxmin policy maximizes the agent i’s utility in the worst-case scenario (against the most malicious opponent).
Therefore, adopting the maxmin policy ensures that the agent’s utility is not lower than the maxmin value. When making decisions solely to maximize their own returns without making any assumptions about other agents, the maxmin
policy is a suitable and conservative choice. The "dual" policy to the maxmin policy is the minimax policy.
Definition 8 (Minmax policy). The minimax policy for other agents −i is arg minπ−i maxπi Qi (πi , π−i ), and the
corresponding minimax value is minπ−i maxπi Qi (πi , π−i ).
These two policies are often applied in constant-sum games. However, in cooperative settings, attention is given to
how agents in the system choose policies through certain coordination means to achieve mutual benefits. Relevant
equilibrium provides a reasonable policy coordination mechanism.
Definition 9 (Correlated Equilibrium). A joint policy π is a correlated equilibrium if, for ∀i ∈ N and ∀ai ∈ Ai ,
X
π(ai, , a−i )[Qi (ai, , a−i ) − Qi (ai , a−i )] ≥ 0,
a−i

where ai,∗ is the best response to a−i .
Correlated equilibrium describes a situation where, assuming two agents follow a correlated policy distribution, no
agent can unilaterally change its current policy to obtain a higher utility. It should be noted that Nash Equilibrium implies that choices made by each agent are independent, i.e., the actions of agents are not correlated. Nash Equilibrium
can be viewed as a special case of correlated equilibrium.

The concepts mentioned above assume that agents make decisions simultaneously. However, in some scenarios, there
may be a sequence of decisions. In such cases, agents are defined as leaders and followers, where leaders make
decisions first, enjoying a first-mover advantage, and followers make decisions afterward.

Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning

Multi-agent Learning (MAL) introduces machine learning techniques into the field of MASs, exploring the design
of algorithms for adaptive agent learning and optimization in dynamic environments. The objective of Multi-agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) (Figure 5) is to train multiple agents in a shared environment using RL methods to
accomplish given tasks [19, 56].
Differing from modeling the multi-step decision-making process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in SARL,
MARL is generally modeled as a Stochastic Game.
Definition 11 (Stochastic Game). A stochastic game can typically be represented by a sextuple ⟨N , S, {Ai }i∈N , P,
{Ri }i∈N , γ⟩, where:
• N = 1, 2, ..., n represents the set of agents in the system. When n = 1, the problem degenerates into a
single-agent Markov Decision Process, and n ≥ 2 is a general stochastic game process.
• S is the state space shared by all agents in the environment.
• Ai is the action space of agent i, defining the joint action space A := A1 × · · · × An .
• P : S × A → ∆(S) is the state transition function, specifying the probability that the environment transitions
from s ∈ S to another state s′ ∈ S at each time step, given a joint action a ∈ A.

10

• Ri : S × A × N → R is the reward function for each agent.
• γ ∈ [0, 1] is the discount factor.
At each time step, agent i ∈ N is in state s, selects action ai ∈ Ai , forms the joint action a = ⟨a1 , . . . , an ⟩, and
executes it. The environment transitions to the next state s′ ∼ P (· | s, a), and agent i receives its own reward Ri (s, a).
Each agent optimizes its policy function πi : S → ∆(Ai ) to maximize its expected cumulative reward, expressed in
the form of a state value function:
X
γ t Ri (st , at )|ait ∼ πi (· | st ),
max Vπi (s) :=E[
πi

t≥0

a−i
t ∼ π−i (· | st ), s0 = s],
where the symbol −i represents all agents except agent i. Unlike in SARL where agents only need to consider
their own impact on the environment, in MASs, agents mutually influence each other, jointly make decisions, and
simultaneously update policies. When the policies of other agents in the system are fixed, agent i can maximize its
own payoff function to find the optimal policy πi∗ relative to the policies of other agents. In MARL, rationality and
convergence are the primary evaluation metrics for learning algorithms.
Definition 12 (Rationality). In the scenario where opponents use a constant policy, rationality is the ability of the
current agent to learn and converge to an optimal policy relative to the opponent’s policy.
Definition 13 (Convergence). When other agents also use learning algorithms, convergence is the ability of the current
agent to learn and converge to a stable policy. Typically, convergence applies to all agents in the system using the
same learning algorithm.
From the above discussions, it is evident that in the process of MARL, each agent aims to increase its own utility.
The learning goal in this case can be to maximize its own Q-function. Therefore, an intuitive learning approach is to
construct an independent Q-function for each agent and update it according to the Q-learning algorithm:
Qi (st , ait ) ← Qi (st , ait ) + α[rt+1 + γ imax Qi (st+1 , ait+1 ) − Qi (st , ait )].
at+1 ∈Ai

(10)

Similar to the SARL algorithm, each agent selects the current action using a greedy policy:
πi (ait |st ) = 1{ait = arg max
Qi (st , ait )}.
i
at

(11)

In the above scenario, we assume that each agent can obtain global state information for decision-making. However,
constrained by real conditions, individuals in MASs often can only obtain limited local observations. To address this
characteristic, we generally model such decision processes as Partially-Observable Stochastic Games (POSG).
Definition 14 (Partially-Observable Stochastic Games (POSG)). The POSG is often defined as M = ⟨N , S, {Ai }i∈N ,
P, {Ri }i∈N , γ, {Ωi }i∈N , O⟩, POSG includes the first six components consistent with the definition 11. Additionally,
it introduces:
• Ωi is the observation space of agent i, and the joint observation space for all agents is Ω := Ω1 × · · · × Ωn .
• O : S → ∆(Ω) represents the observation function, O(o|s), indicating the probability function concerning
the joint observation o given a state s.
In POSG, each agent optimizes its policy πi : Ωi → ∆(Ai ) to maximize its return. Although POSG is widely
applied in real scenarios, theoretical results prove its problem-solving difficulty is NEXP-hard [84]. Fortunately,
recent technologies, including centralized MARL training frameworks, utilizing recurrent neural networks to encode
historical information [85], and agent communication [20], have alleviated this issue from different perspectives.
In cooperative tasks, POSG can be further modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
(Dec-POMDP) [84]. The main difference lies in the fact that in Dec-POMDP, the reward functions for each agent
are identical. Beyond the challenges of partial observability, MARL faces unique problems compared to SARL. In
MARL, the state space becomes larger, and the action space experiences the "curse of dimensionality" problem as the
number of agents grows [56]. Additionally, issues such as scalability, credit assignment, heterogeneity, and cooperative
exploration have hindered the development of MARL [55].

2.2.4

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training Paradigms

In MARL, training is the process of optimizing policies based on acquired experience (states, actions, rewards, etc.),
while execution involves agents interacting with the environment by executing actions according to individual or joint
policies. Generally, depending on whether agents need information from other agents during policy updates, the
training process can be categorized into Centralized Training and Decentralized Training. Correspondingly, based
on whether external information is required during the execution phase, it is categorized into Centralized Execution
and Decentralized Execution. Combining these phases, MARL encompasses three paradigms: Decentralized Training Decentralized Execution (DTDE), Centralized Training Centralized Execution (CTCE), and Centralized Training
Decentralized Execution (CTDE), as illustrated in Figure 6.
Definition 15 (Decentralized Training Decentralized Execution (DTDE)). In the DTDE framework, each agent independently updates its policy and executes using only its local information, without any information exchange. The
policy is represented as πi : Ωi → ∆(Ai ).
IQL [86] is a typical algorithm based on DTDE, known for its scalability as it only considers the individual agent.
However, due to the lack of consideration for information from other agents, agents often operate in a non-stationary
environment, as defined in Section 2.1. To address the inefficiency brought by decentralized learning, optimistic and
delayed optimization assign greater update weights to better Q values, alleviating the non-stationarity issue. Techniques like recurrent neural networks can also mitigate these problems.
When updating policies using DQN, direct usage of data from experience replay buffer exacerbates non-stationarity.
Importance sampling can be employed to alleviate this issue:
L(θi ) =

tc
π−i
(a−i |o−i )
ti
π−i
(a−i |o−i )

[(yiQ − Qi (oi , ai ; θi ))2 ],

where θi is the Q network parameters for agent i, tc is the current time, ti is the sample collection time, and yiQ is the
temporal difference target, calculated similarly to the single-agent case.
Definition 16 (Centralized Training Centralized Execution (CTCE)). In the CTCE framework, agents learn a centralized joint policy:
π : Ω → ∆(A),
and exectues accordingly.
Here, any SARL algorithm can be used to train MASs. However, the complexity of the algorithm grows exponentially
with the dimensions of states and actions [87]. This issue can be addressed through policy or value decomposition.
While decomposition methods alleviate the dimension explosion problem, CTCE struggles to evaluate the mutual
influences among agents. Recently, attention has been given to the Centralized Training Decentralized Execution
(CTDE) framework, especially in complex scenarios.
Definition 17 (Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE)). In the CTDE framework, during the training
phase, agents optimize their local policies with access to information from other agents or even global information:

12

πi : Ωi → ∆(Ai ). During the decentralized execution process, agents make decisions using only their local information.
CTDE has found widespread applications in MASs, particularly excelling in certain complex scenarios. However,
when dealing with heterogeneous MASs, CTDE may face challenges. Skill learning or grouping followed by local
CTDE training are proposed solutions. Additionally, research has discussed centralized and decentralized aspects from
various perspectives [88, 89].
2.2.5

Challenges and Difficulties in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Compared to SARL, real-world scenarios are often better modeled as MARL. However, the presence of multiple
agents simultaneously updating their policies introduces more challenges. This section discusses key challenges in
MARL, including non-stationarity, scalability, partial observability, and current solutions.
In a single-agent system, the agent only considers its own interaction with the environment, resulting in a fixed transition of the environment. However, in MASs, simultaneous policy updates by multiple agents lead to a dynamic target
process, termed non-stationarity.
Definition 18 (Non-Stationarity Problem). In multi-agent systems, a particular agent i faces a dynamic target process,
where for any πi ̸= π i :
P (s′ |s, a, πi , π−i ) ̸= P (s′ |s, a, π̄i , π−i ).
Non-stationarity indicates that, with simultaneous learning and updates by multiple agents, learning no longer adheres
to Markovian properties. This issue is more severe in updates of Q values, particularly methods relying on experience
replay, where sampling joint actions in multi-agent environments is challenging. To address non-stationarity, solutions
involve modeling opponents (teammates), importance sampling of replay data, centralized training, or incorporating
meta-RL considering updates from other teammates.
Definition 19 (Scalability Issue). To tackle non-stationarity, multi-agent systems often need to consider the joint
actions of all agents in the environment, leading to an exponential rise in joint actions with an increasing number of
agents.
In real-world scenarios, the number of agents in MASs is often substantial, such as in autonomous driving environments where there may be hundreds or even thousands of agents. Scalability becomes essential but is also a highly
challenging aspect. Current methods to address scalability include parameter sharing, where homogeneous agents
share neural networks, and heterogeneous agents undergo independent training [24]. Alternatively, techniques such
as transfer learning or curriculum learning involve training initially with fewer agents and progressively scaling up to
environments with a larger number of agents [60].
Due to sensor limitations and other factors, agents often struggle to obtain global states and can only access partial
information. MARL is often modeled as Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSG), where the environment,
from an individual agent’s perspective, no longer adheres to Markovian properties, posing training challenges.
Various solutions have been proposed, including multi-agent communication, where agents exchange information
to alleviate local observation issues. Key questions in communication involve determining who to communicate
with, what information to communicate, and when to communicate. Current research explores three communication
topologies (Figure 7): broadcasting information to all agents, forming network structures for selective communication,
or communicating with a subset of neighbors. Policies for handling these questions include direct exchange of local
information, preprocessing information before transmission, and optimizing communication timing. In conclusion, the
challenges of non-stationarity, scalability, and partial observability in MARL demand innovative solutions to ensure
effective learning and decision-making in complex, real-world scenarios.

Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Classical Environments

Concept of Multi-agent Cooperation

Previously, we mentioned that MASs can be categorized into fully cooperative, fully competitive, and mixed settings
based on task characteristics. Among these settings, competitive scenarios are generally solved by modeling them as
zero-sum games, while mixed scenarios involve a combination of cooperation and competition. This section focuses
on cooperative MARL algorithms, which have been extensively researched.

Definition 20 (Fully Cooperative). In MARL, fully cooperative refers to all agents sharing a common reward function,
satisfying the condition:
R1 = R2 = · · · = Rn = R.
In cooperative MARL, where agents share a common reward function, it is evident that agents have identical returns.
With a centralized controller, the learning process can degrade into a Markov Decision Process, and the action space
of agents becomes a joint action space for a stochastic game. The optimization objective is as follows:
Q(st , at ) ← Q(st , at ) + α[rt + γ max Q(st+1 , at+1 ) − Q(st , at )].
at+1 ∈A

(12)

However, in real-world scenarios, this objective is challenging for multi-agent decision-making because agents often
independently make decisions. Concretely, agents may choose actions belong to different optimal joint actions, due
to decentralized execution. Ignoring inter-agent cooperation behavior [90], early distributed Q-learning algorithms
assumed a single optimal equilibrium point, allowing for the direct use of the above formula, where each agents only
update its local action-value function Qi (s, ai ).
Definition 21 (Credit Assignment Problem). In fully cooperative MARL, where agents share global rewards, accurately evaluating the contribution of an agent’s action to the entire system becomes a challenge.
Definition 22 (Coordination-Free Multi-Agent Cooperation Method). Assuming each agent’s local action-value function is Qi (st , ait ), its update is as follows:
Qi (st , ait ) ← max{Qi (st , ait ), rt + γ imax Qi (st+1 , ait+1 )}.
at+1 ∈Ai

(13)

Coordination-free approach ignores poorly rewarded actions. However, consistently choosing the maximum operation may lead to overestimation issues, and it often lacks scalability due to the calculation based on the joint action
function [91].
Definition 23 (Joint Action Learnng). Assuming agents are in a globally observable environment, observing the states
and actions of all teammates, each agent’s policy is πi , and there exists a global value function Q(s, a), then for agent
i, its local action value can be assessed as:
X
Y
Qi (st , ai ) =:
Q(⟨ai , a−i ⟩)
πj (aj ).
a−i ∈A−i

j̸=i

Simultaneously, in special scenarios, multi-agent cooperation can be indirectly achieved through role assignment,
coordination graphs, multi-agent communication, etc. Additionally, distributed systems often obtain only local observations. We generally model cooperative MARL as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG), a special case of
Dec-POMDP. In Dec-POMDPs, each agent shares the same reward function. We observe that when all agents share a
reward function and return, some agents can receive rewards without making a substantial contribution to the system,
leading to the credit assignment problem in the MAS [22, 92].

Typical Cooperative MARL Algorithms
Policy-Gradient-Based MARL Methods

In cooperative MARL, where rewards and returns among agents are identical, all agents possess the same value
function. We denote the global action value function as Qπ (s, a) and the state value function as Vπ (s). It’s worth
noting that, in MARL, the action value function and state value function of an agent depend on the policies of all
agents:
π1 (a1 |o1 , θ1 ), π2 (a2 |o2 , θ2 ), · · · , πn (an |on , θn ).
Here, θi represents the policy parameters of agent i, and the differences in policies among agents mainly manifest in
the differences in policy parameters. In the process of policy learning, our objective is to optimize policy parameters
to maximize the objective function:
J(θ1 , · · · , θn ) = Es [Vπ (s)].
All agents share a common goal, optimizing their policy parameters θi to maximize the objective function J. Thus,
the optimization objective can be expressed as follows:
max J(θ1 , · · · , θn ).

θ 1 ,··· ,θ n

For a specific agent, by performing gradient ascent, we maximize the objective function:
θi ← θi + αi ∇θi J(θ1 , · · · , θn ).
Here, αi is the learning rate, and the stopping criterion is the convergence of the objective function. In the above
equation, direct computation of the gradient is not feasible, and a value network is commonly employed to approximate
the policy gradient.
Theorem 1 (Policy Gradient Theorem of Cooperative MARL). Suppose there exists a baseline function b independent
of joint actions. Then, cooperative MARL has the following policy gradient:
∇θi J(θ1 , · · · , θn ) = E[∇θi log πi (ai |oi , θi ) · (Qπ (s, a) − b)].
Here, the joint actions is sampled from the joint action distribution:
π(a|o, θ) = π1 (a1 |o1 ; θ1 ) × · · · × πn (an |on ; θn )

(14)

15

Here, we focus on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm [28] (Figure 8). The
algorithm’s pseudocode is provided in Algorithm 1. One one hand, each agent corresponds to a distributed deterministic policy, the Actor module πi (oi ; θi ), and decisions are made by agents based on their respective Actors. On the other
hand, each agent is equipped with a centralized Critic network Qi (s, a; ϕi ) to guide the updating and optimization of
i
the Actor network. Specifically, MADDPG additionally maintains a target policy πi′ (oi ; θ−
) for delayed updates to
calculate the temporal difference target value for the Critic:
yiQ = r + γQi (s′ , a′ |ϕi )|a′j =π′ (o′ j ;θj ) ,
j

−

L(ϕ ) = (yiQ − Qi (s, a; ϕi ))2 .

Furthermore, we use the Critic to guide the Actor with the following update:

MADDPG is a typical algorithm based on the CTDE framework. Training the critic network requires access to the
environment’s global state information. In environments where global state information is unavailable, usually only
the observation information oi of other agents is accessible. As the number of agents increases, training the Critic
network becomes more challenging. Techniques such as attention mechanisms [93] can be employed for information
aggregation to alleviate the computational cost arising from changes in quantity. Additionally, MADDPG can handle
competitive settings. However, due to privacy concerns, it may not be possible to obtain the actions of other agents. In
such cases, opponent modeling [59] can be used to estimate the action information of other agents.
MADDPG in cooperative MARL tasks does not explicitly consider the credit assignment problem. To explicitly
model the contributions of each agent in cooperative MASs (or the rewards they should receive), the Counterfactual
Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) algorithm [92] is widely used. First, the counterfactual baseline is defined:
Definition 24 (Counterfactual Baseline for Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems). In cooperative MARL, assuming the
existence of a global state-action value function Q(s, a), when the policies of other agents are fixed, the advantage
function for agent i at the current action is defined as:
X
Ai (s, a) = Q(s, a) −
π i (a′i |oi )Q(s, ⟨a−i , a′i ⟩).
a′i

In the above definition, Ai (s, a) calculates the baseline function using a centralized Critic for each agent i. This
baseline function is then used to compute its policy gradient:
Definition 25 (Policy Gradient based on COMA). For a MARL algorithm based on the Actor-Critic framework and
considering T D(1) Critic optimization, the policy gradient is given by:

Value Decomposition MARL Methods

While CTDE-based multi-agent policy gradient methods show promising performance in some application scenarios, and methods based on attention mechanisms, such as MAAC [93], can alleviate the curse of dimensionality to
some extent, and methods based on counterfactual baselines can address the credit assignment problem to a certain
extent. However, in complex cooperative scenarios, such as micro-management in StarCraft [33], these methods
are often inefficient. On the contrary, MARL methods based on value decomposition have shown better performance [94]. In the following discussion, we will change the input of the value function from observation oit to
trajectory τti = (o1 , a1 , ..., at−1 , ot ) ∈ T i , thus partially alleviating the problems caused by partial observability. It
is worth noting that this technique can also be used in policy-gradient-based methods mentioned above to improve
coordination performance. Most value decomposition methods are based on the Individual-Global-Max (IGM) principle [83].
Theorem 2 (Individual-Global-Max Principle). For a joint action value function Qtot : T × A and local individual
action value functions {Qi : T i × Ai → R}ni=1 , if the following equation holds:


arg max Qtot (τ , a) = 

then, Qtot and {Qi }ni=1 satisfy the Individual-Global-Max principle.
Three typical value decomposition methods that satisfy the IGM principle are as follows. VDN [30] represents the
joint Q function as the sum of local Q functions:
QVDN


Qi τ i , ai .

(17)

Although this value decomposition method satisfies IGM, its network expressiveness is often insufficient and it performs poorly in complex scenarios. QMIX [31] (see Figure 9) extends VDN by introducing a mixing network that
combines the Q values of each agent with the global state to calculate the global utility and perform credit assignment.
To ensure IGM, the mixing network takes the individual Q values and the state as inputs, calculates the global Q value,
and satisfies certain conditions:
QQMIX

Integrating Policy Gradient and Value Decomposition in Cooperative MARL

In addition to the aforementioned methods based on policy gradient and value decomposition, some works combine the
advantages of both to develop algorithms. One such algorithm is Decomposed Off-policy multi-agent Policy gradients
(DOP) [97] (as shown in Figure 10), which introduces the idea of value decomposition into the multi-agent actor-critic
framework and learns a centralized but decomposed critic. This framework decomposes the centralized critic into a
weighted linear sum of individual critics with local actions as inputs. This decomposition structure not only achieves
scalable learning of critics but also brings several benefits. It realizes feasible off-policy evaluation for stochastic
policies, alleviates the centralized-decentralized inconsistency problem, and implicitly learns efficient multi-agent

reward allocation. Based on this decomposition, DOP develops efficient off-policy multi-agent decomposed policy
gradient methods for both discrete and continuous action spaces.
DOP’s specific contributions include: (1) To address the credit assignment problem in MASs and the scalability
problem of learning a centralized critic, DOP uses linear value function decomposition to learn a centralized critic,
enabling local policy gradients to be derived for each agent based on individual value functions. (2) DOP proposes offpolicy MARL algorithms for both stochastic policy gradients and deterministic policy gradients, effectively handling
tasks with discrete and continuous action spaces, respectively. (3) Considering the sample efficiency issue of policy
gradient algorithms, DOP combines linear value function decomposition with tree-backup techniques, proposing an
efficient off-policy critic learning method to improve the sample efficiency of policy learning. In addition to DOP, other
work combines the advantages of value decomposition and policy gradient from different perspectives. VDAC [98]
directly integrated policy gradient-like methods with value decomposition methods, proposing methods based on linear
summation and mixed neural networks. IAC [99], based on MAAC, further optimizes the credit assignment between
agents through value decomposition methods, achieving surprising coordination performance in various environments.
FACMAC [100] proposed a decomposable joint policy gradient multi-agent algorithm and proposes the continuous
environment multi-agent testing environment MAMuJoCo, FOP [101] designed a value decomposition and gradient
decomposition method based on maximum entropy, RIIT [102] integrated some common techniques in current MARL
into the coordination algorithms and proposes a new open-source algorithm framework PyMARL2 † .

Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Classical Environments

In addition to methods aimed at improving cooperative capabilities discussed in the previous section, researchers
have explored cooperative MARL from various perspectives, including efficient exploration, communication, and
more. The core content, representative algorithms, and applications or achievements in various research directions in
classical environments are summarized in Table 1.
3.3.1

Cooperative Multi-Agent Exploration

RL methods strive to efficiently learn optimal policies, where high-quality training samples are crucial, and exploration
plays a key role during the sampling process, constituting a vital aspect of RL [150]. Similar to exploration techniques
widely used in single-agent scenarios, exploration in cooperative MARL has garnered attention. Initial algorithms
like QMIX and MADDPG, designed for multi-agent tasks, lacked specific exploration policies and underperformed
in certain complex scenarios. Subsequent works aim at addressing multi-agent exploration challenges. MAVEN [104]
introduced a latent variable to maximize mutual information between this variable and generated trajectories, addressing the exploration limitations of value decomposition methods like QMIX. EITI and EDTI [105] proposed
cooperative exploration methods by considering interactions among agents, demonstrating improved coordination in
various environments. CMAE [107] uses constrained space selection to encourage exploration in regions with higher
value, enhancing cooperative efficiency. EMC [106] extends single-agent, motion-based exploration methods to the
multi-agent domain and proposes episodic-memory-based approaches to store high-value trajectories for exploration
facilitation. Uneven [108] improves exploration efficiency by simultaneously learning multiple task sets, obtaining
a multi-agent generalization feature to address relative overgeneralization in multi-agent scenarios. SMMAE [109]
balances individual and team exploration to enhance coordination efficiency, achieving satisfactory results in com†

plex tasks. Recently developed ADER [151] focused on studying the balance between exploration and exploitation in
cooperative multi-agent tasks.
Additionally, various methods have explored multi-agent exploration from different perspectives, such as intrinsic reward exploration [152], decentralized multi-agent exploration in distributed scenarios [153, 154], information-based
exploration methods [155], cooperative exploration under unknown initial conditions [156], exploration problems in
multi-agent multi-armed bandit settings [157], exploration-exploitation balance in competitive multi-agent scenarios [158], structure-based exploration methods [159], optimistic exploration [160], and exploration in reward-sparse
scenarios [161]. While these methods have shown promising results in diverse testing environments, developing test
environments tailored for various exploration algorithms and proposing comprehensive theories for multi-agent exploration remain worthwhile areas for future research.
3.3.2

Multi-Agent Communication

Communication plays a crucial role in MASs, enabling agents to share experiences, intentions, observations, and other
vital information based on communication technology (Figure 11 [20]). Three factors typically characterize multiagent communication: when, with which agents, and what type of information is exchanged. Early research focused
on integrating communication with existing MARL to improve coordination efficiency. DIAL [110] introduced a
simple communication mechanism where agents broadcast information to all teammates, facilitating end-to-end RL
training. CommNet [162] proposed an efficient centralized communication structure where hidden layer outputs of
all agents are collected and averaged to enhance local observations. VBC [111] adds a variance-based regularizer to
eliminate noise components in information, achieving lower communication overhead and better performance than
other methods. IC3Net [163], Gated-ACML [164], and I2C [112] learn gating mechanisms to decide when and with
which teammates to communicate, reducing information redundancy. SMS [165] models multi-agent communication
as a cooperative game, evaluating the importance of each message for decision-making and trimming channels with no
positive gain. MASIA [115] introduced the concept of information aggregation, extracting information effectively for
decision-making at the information receiver. Additionally, it designed an open-source offline communication dataset,
demonstrating the efficiency and rationality of the proposed communication structure in various experiments.
Some works have focused on determining the content of communication. TarMAC [113] generate information by
appending signatures, and the receiver use attention mechanisms to calculate the similarity between its local observation and the information signatures from different teammates. DAACMP [166], based on the MADDPG [28]
framework, introduced a dual attention mechanism, showing that attention improves the coordination performance
of MASs. NDQ [167] uses information-theoretic regularization to design two different information-theoretic regu-

larization terms for optimizing the value function, achieving good coordination performance in locally observable
scenarios. TMC [168] applied smoothing and action selection regularizers for concise and robust communication,
adding received information as an incentive to individual value functions. MAIC [114] designed a decentralized incentive communication based on teammate modeling, demonstrating excellent communication efficiency in various
task scenarios. Recent works, including CroMAC [169], AME [170], R-MACRL [49], and MA3C [171] focus on
communication policy robustness during deployment, addressing potential communication interference issues. While
existing methods have demonstrated effectiveness in various task scenarios, the natural gap between multi-agent environments and human society poses challenges. Exploring ways to bridge this gap through technologies like large
language models [172], promoting human-AI interaction, and conducting interpretable research on communication
content are promising areas for future study.
3.3.3

Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Agent Modeling

Endowing agents with the ability to infer actions, goals, and beliefs of other agents in the environment is a key
focus in MARL, particularly in cooperative tasks [59]. Effective and accurate modeling techniques enable agents
to collaborate efficiently (Figure 12). One direct approach is employing Theory of Mind (ToM) from psychology,
where ToMnet [116], and subsequent works like ToM2C [173], CTH [174], and [175], incorporate psychological
theories into multi-agent tasks, enhancing teammate modeling and improving coordination capabilities. More details
and development of ToM can be seen in [176].
Alternatively, some works employ different techniques to model other teammates. OMDDPG [117] uses Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) to infer the behavior of other agents based on local information. LIAM [118] extended this technique to locally observable conditions, developing an efficient teammate modeling technique. LINDA [177] mitigates
local observability issues by considering perceived teammate information, assisting in enhancing MAS coordination
across diverse tasks. MACC [121] uses local information learning for subtask representation to augment individual
policies. MAIC [114] introduced a communication-based method for teammate modeling, extracting crucial information for efficient decision-making. LILI [119] considered agent modeling in robotic scenarios and developed algorithms based on high-level policy representation learning to promote coordination. SILI [178] further considered
learning a smooth representation to model other agents based on LILI. Literature [179] empowered robots to understand their own behaviors and develop technologies to better assist humans in achieving rapid value alignment.
In addition to the modeling techniques mentioned above, SOM [180] enables agents to learn how to predict the behaviors of teammates by using their own policies, and update their unknown target beliefs about other teammates online
accordingly. MBOM [120] developed adversary modeling techniques based on model learning. [181] takes modeling the behavior of other agents as an additional objective when optimizing the policy. DPIQN and DRPIQN [182]
considered modeling multi-agent task scenarios with policy changes and propose using a policy feature optimizer to
optimize policy learning. ATT-MADDPG [183] obtains a joint teammate representation to evaluate teammate policies
and promote multi-agent coordination via attention based MADDPG [184]. Literature [185] and subsequent work
considered solving the cyclic inference problem in teammate modeling through techniques such as probability inference. Literature [186] proposed TeamReg and CoachReg to evaluate the action choices of the team and achieve better
coordination. The aforementioned works have shown good coordination performance in various task scenarios. However, in these works, agents need to model other agents or entities in the environment. When dealing with large-scale

agent systems or a large number of entities, using above methods will greatly increase computational complexity. Developing technologies such as distributed grouping to improve computational efficiency is one of the future research
directions and valuable topics.
3.3.4

Multi-Agent Policy Imitation

Imitation Learning (IL) [187] offers a method for agents to make intelligent decisions by mimicking human experts. In
multi-agent scenarios, IL has advanced significantly. For example, [188] proposed to learn a probabilistic cooperative
model in latent space from demonstration data. [189] extended this by using a hierarchical structure for high-level
intention modeling. [190] employed a connection structure [191] to explicitly model coordination relationships. Multiagent Inverse RL (IRL) has also been explored, with MAGAIL [122] extending adversarial generative techniques to
MASs. MA-AIRL [123] developed a scalable algorithm for high-dimensional state spaces and unknown dynamic
environments. [192] learns a reward function based on the representation space to represent the behavior of agents.
CoDAIL [124] introduced a distributed adversarial imitation learning method based on correlated policies. DM2 [125]
recently presented a distributed multi-agent imitation learning method based on distribution matching. MIFQ [193]
studied a decomposed multi-agent IRL method, demonstrating excellent performance in various scenarios.
Other research have explored multi-agent imitation learning from different perspectives, including applications in imitatiing driving [194], policy research in multi-agent IRL [195], multi-agent IRL without demonstration data [196],
application to mean field game problems [197], design for mulit-agent systems in distributed constrained IRL [198],
and asynchronous multi-agent imitation learning [199]. Despite progress in various aspects, there’s a need for research
exploring large-scale scenarios, handling heterogeneous or suboptimal demonstration data, and applying multi-agent
imitation learning to real-world scenarios like autonomous driving. Investigating these aspects and fostering coordination between AI and domain experts can drive significant advancements in multi-agent policy imitation.
3.3.5

Model-Based Cooperative MARL

Reinforcement learning, due to its need for continual interaction with the environment for policy optimization, often
employs model-free algorithms, where agents use samples from interaction with the environment. However, these
algorithms frequently suffer from low sample efficiency. Model-based RL, considered to have higher sample efficiency, typically involves learning the environment’s state transition function (often including the reward function),
i.e., the world model. Subsequently, policy optimization is conducted based on the knowledge derived from the world
model [67, 200], leading to a significant improvement in sample efficiency.
In recent years, model-based MARL has garnered attention and made progress [35]. Early efforts extended successful
techniques in single-agent scenarios to multi-agent settings. For instance, MAMBPO [126] extended the MBPO
method [201] to multi-agent tasks, constructing a model-based RL system based on the CTDE paradigm and a world
model. This approach moderately enhances the system’s sampling efficiency. CTRL [202] and AORPO [127] further
introduced opponent modeling techniques into model learning to acquire adaptive trajectory data, augmenting the
original data. MARCO [203] learns a multi-agent world model and employs it to learn a centralized exploration

23

policy to collect more data in high uncertainty areas, enhancing multi-agent policy learning. Some techniques extend
widely used single-agent methods, such as Dreamer [204], to multi-agent tasks. MBVD [128] learns an implicit world
model based on value decomposition, enabling agents to evaluate state values in latent space, providing them with
foresight. MAMBA [129] enhances centralized training in cooperative scenarios using model-based RL. The study
discovers that algorithm optimization can be achieved during training through a world model and, during execution, a
new corresponding world model can be established through communication. VDFD [130] significantly improves the
sample efficiency of MARL by developing techniques that decouple the learning of the world model.
Additionally, researchers explore the learning of world models in MASs from various perspectives, such as collision avoidance in distributed robot control [205], safety and efficiency improvement [206], agent interaction
modeling [207], optimization of distributed network systems [208], model-based opponent modeling [120], efficiency improvement in multi-agent communication through model-based learning [209–211], model-based mean-field
MARL [212], efficient multi-agent model learning [213], improving the learning efficiency of offline MARL through
model learning [214], and applications of model-based MARL [215]. Although some of these methods have achieved
certain results, the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality with the increasing number of agents and the partial
observability introduced by decentralized execution often hinder the development of model-based MARL algorithms.
Exploring efficient methods tailored to the characteristics of MASs, such as subset selection [216], is an essential
research direction.
3.3.6

Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Skill Learning

Reinforcement learning faces the challenge of the curse of dimensionality in complex scenarios. To address this
issue, researchers have proposed hierarchical RL (HRL) [217]. The primary goal of HRL is to decompose complex
problems into smaller ones, solve each subproblem independently, and thus achieve the overall goal. In recent years,
there have been advancements in multi-agent hierarchical RL [218]. FHM [131] introduced a feudal lord structure into
the process of MARL. This method is designed for scenarios where agents have different task objectives but may not
be suitable for cooperative tasks with shared objectives. To address the sparse and delayed reward issues in multi-agent
tasks, [219] proposed a hierarchical version of the QMIX algorithm and a hierarchical communication structure. This
method achieves excellent cooperation performance in various task scenarios but requires manual design of high-level
actions. HSD [132] generates corresponding skills through an high-level macro policy, and this method is mainly
trained through supervised learning. RODE [133] learns action representations and selects actions hierarchically to
enhance cooperation performance in various scenarios. VAST [220] addresses the efficiency issues in large-scale
multi-agent cooperation tasks through a hierarchical approach. ALMA [134] fully exploits the task structure in multiagent tasks and uses high-level subtask decomposition policies and lower-level agent execution policies. HAVEN [135]
introduces a bidirectional hierarchical structure for both inter-agent and intra-agent coordination to further improve
multi-agent cooperation efficiency.
Apart from the mentioned works, some skill-based approaches in SARL have made progress [221] and have been
applied to MARL. [222] considered integrating skills into MASs to improve overall performance. HSL [223] designs
a method to extract heterogeneous and sufficiently diverse skills from various tasks for downstream task learning.
ODIS [34] focuses on extracting skills from offline datasets. MASD [224] aims to discover skills beneficial for
cooperation by maximizing the mutual information between the potential skill distribution and the combination of
all agent states and skills. SPC [225] focuses on the automatic curriculum learning process of skill populations in
MARL. [226] also explores learning to augment multi-agent skills. While these methods to some extent learn or use
skills in MASs, the interpretability of the learned skills is currently lacking. Exploring ways to make the learned skills
interpretable, such as bridging the gap between MASs and the human society through natural language [227], is a
topic worth researching.
3.3.7

Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Topology Structure Learning

The interaction among agents is a focal point in the study of multi-agent problems. A coordination graph is a method
that explicitly characterizes the interaction between agents by decomposing the multi-agent value function into a
graph representation [136, 228]. In recent years, this approach has been widely applied in cooperative MARL. In coordination graph-based MARL tasks, nodes generally represent agents, and edges (hyper-edges) represent connected
relationships between agents, constructing a reward function on the joint observation action space. A coordination
graph can represent a high-order form of value decomposition among multiple agents. Typically, Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) algorithms [229] are employed to find action selections that maximize the value. Agents
can exchange information through connected edges over multiple rounds. DCG [137] introduces some deep learning
techniques into coordination graphs, expanding them into high-dimensional state-action spaces. In complex task scenarios, such as SMAC, DCG can relieve the relative overgeneralization issues among multiple agents. However, DCG

24

mainly focuses on pre-training on static and dense topological structures, exhibiting poor scalability and requiring
dense and inefficient communication methods in dynamic environments.
A core issue in coordination graph problems is how to learn a dynamic and sparse graph structure that satisfies agent
action selection. Sparse cooperative Q-function learning [230] attempts to learn sparse graph structures for value function learning. However, the graph structure learned by this method is static and requires substantial prior knowledge.
Literature [231] proposed learning a minimal dynamic graph set for each agent, but the computational complexity
exponentially increases with the number of agent neighbors. Literature [232] studies the expressiveness of some graph
structures but mainly focuses on random topologies and stateless problems. Literature [141] proposed a new coordination graph testing environment, MACO, and introduced the Context-Aware Sparse Deep Coordination Graphs
algorithm (CASEC). This algorithm effectively reduces the reward function evaluation error introduced during the
graph construction process by learning induced representations and performs well in multiple environments. Subsequent work also enhances coordination from multiple perspectives, such as developing nonlinear coordination graph
structures [233], self-organizing polynomial coordination graph structures [234], and so on.
On the other hand, some methods use techniques such as attention mechanisms to find implicit graph structures among
multiple agents by cutting unnecessary connection structures through attention mechanisms. For instance, ATOC [140]
learns the most essential communication structure through attention mechanisms. DICG [138] learns implicit coordination graph structures through attention mechanisms. MAGIC [139] improves the communication efficiency and
teamwork of MASs through graph attention mechanisms. Although these methods can to some extent obtain or improve the interaction topology between agents, currently, these methods generally make progress only in scenarios
with a small number of agents. The challenge of obtaining the optimal topology structure in large-scale and strongly
interacting scenarios is a future research direction [235].
3.3.8

Other Aspects

In addition to the extensively researched topics mentioned above, several other aspects are gradually being explored
and uncovered in MARL. These include but are not limited to cooperative interpretability [142], developing multiagent cooperation algorithms with decision-making order [32, 143, 236, 237], theoretical analysis of multi-agent
cooperation [22, 238, 239], multi-agent multi-task (stage) cooperation learning [144], social dilemma problems in
MASs [240], asynchronous multi-agent cooperation [241, 242], large-scale multi-agent cooperation [243], delayed
reward in multi-agent cooperation [244], multi-agent cooperation in mixed action spaces [145], discovery of causal relationships in multi-agent cooperation [63], curriculum learning in multi-agent cooperation [146], research on teacherstudent relationships in cooperative MARL [147], fairness in MASs [148], and entity-based multi-agent cooperation [149], among others.
3.4

Typical Benchmark Scenarios

While designing and researching algorithms, some works have developed a series of test environments to comprehensively evaluate algorithms from various aspects. Typical environments include the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge
(SMAC) [33] and its improved version SMACv2 [245], SMAClite [246], Multi-Agent Particle World (MPE) [28],
Multi-Agent MuJoCo (MAMuJoCo) [100], Google Research Football (GRF) [247], Large-scale Multi-Agent Environment (MAgent) [248], Offline MARL Test Environment [249], and Multi-Agent Taxi Environment TaxAI [250],
among others. Common multi-agent test environments and their characteristics are shown in Table 3. Moreover, for
the convenience of future work, some researchers have integrated and open-sourced the current mainstream testing
environments, including Pymarl [33] ‡ , EPyMARL [251]§ , PettingZoo [252]¶ , MARLlib [253]|| , and the environment
from the 1st AI Agents Contest** , among others.
3.5

Typical Application Scenarios

Meanwhile, cooperative MARL algorithms have been widely applied in various task scenarios, including gaming,
industrial applications, robot control, cross-disciplinary applications, and military domains [17, 275–278].
Early multi-agent algorithms primarily focused on the gaming domain, optimizing policies using RL algorithms.

remarkable performance in controlling in-game agents to defeat opponents in StarCraft [16, 279]. Subsequent works
extended MARL algorithms to other gaming tasks. The ViVO team achieved effective adversarial results in controlling hero units in the game Honor of Kings using hierarchical RL in various scenarios [280]. Many test environments,
including SMAC [33], are developed based on game engines. Besides real-time games, MARL has also shown success in non-real-time games such as chess [281], Chinese chess [282], mahjong [283], poker [284], football [247],
basketball games [261, 285], and hide-and-seek [260].
On the other hand, researchers have explored applying MARL to industrial domains. Leveraging the significant potential of MARL in problem-solving, studies model industrial problems as MARL tasks. For example, in [286],
unmanned driving is modeled as a cooperative problem, promoting cooperation between unmanned vehicles using a
coordination graph. The study found that automatic vehicle scheduling can be achieved in various task scenarios. Other
related works use MARL to enhance traffic signal control [287], unmanned driving [288], drone control [289, 290],
and autonomous vehicle control [291]. Additionally, researchers have explored power-related applications, such as
controlling the frequency of wind power generation using MARL algorithms [292]. Some works have delved into
finance, applying MARL in various scenarios [293–295]. Furthermore, MAAB [296] designs an online automatic
bidding framework based on MARL, addressing other issues [297]. In addition, some works synchronize clocks on
FPGAs using MARL [298], and in the context of virtual Taobao, MARL is applied for better capturing user preferences [299]. Some studies focus on controlling robots using MARL [300–302], such as [303], applying cooperative
MARL to cooperative assistance tasks in robot surgery, significantly improving task completion.
MARL is also applied in cross-disciplinary fields. For instance, MA-DAC [27] models multi-parameter optimization
problems as MARL tasks and solves them using cooperative MARL algorithms like QMIX, significantly enhancing
the ability to optimize multiple parameters. MA2ML [304] effectively addresses optimization learning problems in
the connection of modules in automated machines using MARL. The study in [305] enriches MARL under rich visual
information and designs navigation tasks in a cooperative setting. Literature [306] proposed a multi-camera cooperative system based on cooperative alignment to solve the active multi-target tracking problem. Literature [307] modeled
image data augmentation as a multi-agent problem, introducing a more fine-grained automatic data method by dividing
an image into multiple grids and finding a jointly optimal enhancement policy. Additionally, many works focus on applying MARL algorithms to combinatorial optimization. Literature [308] studies optimizing online parking allocation
through MARL, literature [309] focuses on lithium-ion battery scheduling using a MARL framework, literature [310]
leverages MARL to solve job scheduling problems in resource preemptive environments, and literature [311] explores
online scheduling problems in small-scale factories using MARL. MARLYC [312] proposed a new method called
MARL yaw control to suggest controlling the yaw of each turbine, ultimately increasing the total power generation
of the farm. Cooperative MARL has also found applications in daily life, such as [313], testing the acoustic effects
in a room using two collaborating robots, and [314], managing energy in daily home environments. Literature [315]
explores online intelligent education based on MARL. Some studies also attempt to apply multi-agent collaboration
techniques to the medical field, such as using multi-agent collaboration for neuron segmentation [316] or medical
image segmentation [317].
In addition to the applications mentioned earlier, MARL has also been explored in the field of national defense applications [318, 319, 319–323]. The work in [324] proposes an approach based on MADDPG and attention mechanisms
capable of handling scenarios with variable teammates and opponents in multi-agent aerial combat tasks. In [325], a
hierarchical MARL (HMARL) approach is introduced to address the cooperative decision-making problem of heterogeneous drone swarms, specifically focusing on the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) mission by decoupling it into two sub-problems: high-level target assignment (TA) and low-level cooperative attack (CA). The study
in [326] constructs a multi-drone cooperative aerial combat system based on MARL. Simulation results indicate that
the proposed strategy learning method can achieve a significant energy advantage and effectively defeat various opponents. In [327], a hierarchical MARL framework for air-to-air combat is proposed to handle scenarios involving
multiple heterogeneous intelligent agents. MAHPG [328] designs a strategy gradient MARL method based on selfplay adversarial training and hierarchical decision networks to enhance the aerial combat performance of the system,
aiming to learn various strategies. Additionally, using hierarchical decision networks to handle complex mixed actions, the study in [329] designs a mechanism based on a two-stage graph attention neural network to capture crucial
interaction relationships between intelligent agents in intelligent aerial combat scenarios. Experiments demonstrate
that this method significantly enhances the system’s collaborative capabilities in large-scale aerial combat scenarios.

Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Environments

The previous content mainly discussed in the context of classical closed environments, where the factors in the environment remain constant. However, research on machine learning algorithms in real environments often needs to
address situations where certain factors may change. This characteristic has given rise to a new research area—open-

27

environment machine learning, including Open-world Learning [330], Open-environment Learning [38], Open-ended
Learning [331], Open-set Learning [332], etc.
4.1

Machine Learning in Open Environments

Traditional machine learning is generally discussed in classical closed environments, where important factors in the
environment do not change. These factors can have different definitions and scopes in different research fields, such as
new categories in supervised learning, new tasks in continual learning, changes in features in neural network inputs,
shifts in the distribution of training (testing) data, and changes in learning objectives across tasks. Open-environment
machine learning [38], to some extent, is related to open-ended learning [331]. In contrast to machine learning in
closed environments, open-environment machine learning primarily considers the possibility of changes in important
factors in the machine learning environment [38]. Previous research in this area has explored category changes in
supervised learning [37], feature changes [333], task changes in continual learning [64], setting of open environments
for testing [334], and open research in game problems [335], among others.
On the other hand, open-environment RL has gained attention and made progress in various aspects in recent years.
Unlike supervised learning, where model is learned from labeled training data, or unsupervised learning, which analyzes inherent information in given data, RL places agents in unfamiliar environments. Agents must interact autonomously with the environment and learn from the results of these interactions. Different interaction methods
generate different data, posing a key challenge in RL—learning from dynamic data distributions that, in turn, further
alter the data distribution [1]. In addition, agents need to consider changes in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of
the environment. Some methods have attempted to learn a trustworthy RL policy [39], learn a highly generalizable
policy through methods like evolutionary learning [40], learn skills for open environments [336], enhance generalization ability by changing the reward function [337], design testing environments for open RL [338], design general
open intelligent agents based on RL [339, 340], study policy generalization in RL [42], etc.
4.2

Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Environments

The aforementioned content introduced some related works on SARL in open environments. Some studies have
provided descriptions of MARL in open environments from specific perspectives. In open MASs, the composition and
scale of the system may change over time due to agents joining or leaving during the coordination process [391].
Classical MARL algorithms primarily address issues such as non-stationarity caused by teammate policy optimization
during training and the exploration and discovery of effective coordination patterns. While these methods effectively
improve sample efficiency and cooperative ability, they do not consider the problem of changes in real-world MASs
and environmental factors. Taking the example of open MASs mentioned earlier, due to changes in teammate behavior
styles, the intelligent agents generated by classical MARL algorithms make decisions based on historical information.
They cannot promptly perceive changes in teammate behavior styles, leading to a certain lag in their adaptive capability, greatly impacting cooperative performance.
In previous works, research focused mainly on multi-agent planning in open situations, giving rise to many related problem settings, such as Open Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Open DecPOMDP) [392], Team-POMDP [393, 394], I-POMDP-Lite [371, 395], and CI-POMDP [396]. Recently, some work
has begun to consider the issue of open MARL. GPL [373] formalizes the problem of Open Ad-hoc Teamwork as
Open Stochastic Bayesian Games (OSBG), assuming global observability to improve efficiency. However, it is challenging to implement in the real world. Additionally, it uses a graph neural network-based method applicable only
to single-controllable intelligent agent settings, making it challenging to extend to multiple controllable intelligent
agents. Recent work [397] proposes OASYS, an open MAS, to describe open MASs.
While the aforementioned works have delved into research on MARL in open environments from specific perspectives,
their focus is relatively narrow, and there are certain limitations. There lacks a comprehensive overview of the entire
research field. We believe that for a cooperative MAS to be applied to complex open real-world scenarios, it should
possess the ability to cope with changes in environmental factors (states, actions, reward functions, etc.), changes in
coordination modes (teammates, opponents), and the emergence of tasks in the form of data streams. This capability
should mainly include the following aspects:
• During policy training and evolution, the system should have the ability for offline policy learning, policies
with transfer and generalization capabilities, policies that support continual learning, and the system should
possess evolution and adaptation capabilities.

• Finally, considering the differences and similarities in various multi-agent cooperative tasks, learning policy

cover various multi-agent cooperative tasks, similar to ChatGPT.
Based on this, this section reviews and compares relevant works in these eleven aspects, presenting the main content
and existing issues in current research, as well as future directions worthy of exploration.
4.2.1

Offline Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Offline reinforcement learning [398, 399] has recently attracted considerable research attention, focusing on a datadriven training paradigm that does not require interaction with the environment [399]. Previous work [400] primarily
addressed distributional shift issues in offline learning, considering learning behavior-constrained policies to alleviate

30

extrapolation errors in estimating unseen data [401–403]. Offline MARL is a relatively new and promising research
direction [404], training cooperative policie’s from static datasets. One class of offline MARL methods attempts to
learn policies from offline data with policy constraints. ICQ [341] effectively mitigated extrapolation errors in MARL
by trusting only offline data. MABCQ [342] introduced a fully distributed setting for offline MARL, utilizing techniques such as value bias and transfer normalization for efficient learning. OMAR [405] combined first-order policy
gradients and zero-order optimization methods to avoid discordant local optima. MADT [344] harnessed the powerful
sequential modeling capability of Transformers, seamlessly integrating it with offline and online MARL tasks. Literature [343] investigated offline MARL, explicitly considering the diversity of agent trajectories and proposing a new
framework called Shared Individual Trajectories (SIT). Literature [406] proposes training a teacher policy with access
to observations, actions, and rewards for each agent first. After determining and gathering "good" behaviors in the
dataset, individual student policies are created and endowed with the structural relationships between the teacher policy’s features and the agents through knowledge distillation. ODIS [34] introduced a novel offline MARL algorithm
for discovering cooperative skills from multi-task data. Literature [249] recently released the Off-the-Grid MARL
(OG-MARL) framework for generating offline MARL datasets and algorithm evaluation. M3 [407] innovatively introduced the idea of multi-task and multi-agent offline pre-training modules to learn higher-level transferable policy
representations. OMAC [345] proposed an offline MARL algorithm based on coupled value decomposition, decomposing the global value function into local and shared components while maintaining credit assignment consistency
between global state values and Q-value functions.
4.2.2

Cooperative Policy Transfer and Generalization

Transfer learning is considered a crucial method to improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms [408], aiming to
reuse knowledge across different tasks, accelerating the policy learning of agents on new tasks. Transfer learning in
multi-agent scenarios [60] has also garnered extensive attention. In addition to considering knowledge reuse between
tasks, some researchers focus on knowledge reuse among agents. The basic idea is to enable some agents to selectively
reuse knowledge from other agents, thereby assisting the overall MAS in achieving better cooperation. DVM [409]
modeled the multi-agent problem as a multi-task learning problem, combining knowledge between different tasks and
distilling this knowledge through a value-matching mechanism. LeCTR [347] conducted policy teaching in multiagent scenarios, guiding some agents to guide others, thus facilitating better policy cooperation overall. MAPTF [348]
proposed an option-based policy transfer method to assist multi-agent cooperation.
On the other hand, methods for policy reuse among multi-agent tasks emphasize the reuse of knowledge and experience from old tasks to assist in the policy learning of new tasks, focusing on knowledge transfer between different
tasks. Compared to single-agent problems, the dimensions of environmental state (observations) may vary in tasks
with different scales of multi-agent tasks, posing challenges to policy transfer among tasks. Specifically, DyMACL [410] designed a network structure independent of the number of agents and introduces a series of transfer mechanisms based on curriculum learning to accelerate the learning process of cooperative policies in multi-agent scenarios.
EPC [349] proposed an evolutionary algorithm-based multi-agent curriculum learning method to help groups achieve
cooperative policy learning in complex scenarios. UPDeT [411] and PIT [412] leveraged the generalization of transformer networks to address the problem of changing environmental input dimensions, aiding efficient cooperation and
knowledge transfer among agent groups. These related works on multi-agent transfer learning provide inspiration for
knowledge transfer between tasks, but they do not explicitly consider the correlation between tasks and how to utilize
task correlation for more efficient knowledge transfer remains an open research topic. MATTAR [351] addressed the
challenge of adapting cooperative policy models to new tasks and proposes a policy transfer method based on task
relations. Literature [413] considers using lateral transfer learning to promote MARL. Literature [350] further focused
on designing algorithms to enhance the generalization ability in MARL.
4.2.3

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Continual coordination

Continual learning, incremental learning and lifelong learning are related, assuming tasks or samples appear sequentially [414]. In recent years, continual RL [41, 415] has received some attention. In this setting, the challenge for
agents is to avoid catastrophic forgetting while transferring knowledge from old tasks to new ones (also known as
the stability-plasticity dilemma [416]), while maintaining scalability to a large number of tasks. Researchers have
proposed various methods to address these challenges. EWC [417] used weight regularization based on l2 distance to
constrain the gap between current model parameters and those of previously learned models, requiring additional supervision to select specific Q-function heads and set exploration policies for different task scenarios. CLEAR [418] is
a task-agnostic continual learning method that does not require task information during the continual learning process.
It maintains a large experience replay buffer and addresses forgetting by sampling data from past tasks. Other methods such as HyperCRL [419] and [420] leveraged learned world models to enhance learning efficiency. To address
scalability issues in scenarios with numerous tasks, LLIRL [421] decomposed the task space into subsets and uses a

Chinese restaurant process to expand neural networks, making continual RL more efficient. OWL [422] is a recent
efficient method based on a multi-head architecture. CSP [423] gradually constructed policy subspaces, training RL
agents on a series of tasks. Another class of means to address scalability issues is based on the idea of Packnet [424],
sequentially encoding task information into neural networks and pruning network nodes for relevant tasks. Regarding
the problem of continual learning in multi-agent settings (see Figure 13), literature [352] investigated whether agents
can cooperate with unknown agents by introducing a multi-agent learning testbed based on Hanabi. However, it only
considers single-modal task scenarios. MACPro [353] proposed a method for achieving continual coordination among
multiple agents through progressive task contextualization. It uses a shared feature extraction layer to obtain task
features but employs independent policy output heads, each making decisions for tasks of specific categories. Macop [354] endowed a MAS with continual coordination capabilities, developing an algorithm based on incompatible
teammate evolution and high-compatibility multi-agent cooperative training paradigms. In various test environments
where teammates switch within and between rounds, the proposed method can quickly capture teammate identities,
demonstrating stronger adaptability and generalization capabilities compared to various comparative methods, even in
unknown scenarios.
4.2.4

Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Evolutionary algorithms [425] constitute a class of heuristic stochastic optimization algorithms simulating the natural
evolution process, including genetic algorithms, evolutionary policies, particle swarm algorithms, etc. (Figure 14).
Despite numerous variants, the main idea remains consistent in solving problems. First, a population is initialized
by generating several individuals as the initial population through random sampling. The remaining process can
be abstracted into a loop of three main steps. Based on the current population, offspring individuals are generated
using operators such as crossover and mutation; the fitness of offspring individuals is evaluated; according to the
survival of the fittest principle, some individuals are eliminated, and the remaining individuals constitute the new
generation. Previous research [216] revealed the rich potential of evolutionary algorithms in solving subset selection
problems. Evolutionary algorithms have also found widespread applications in the multi-agent domain [426], such as
α-Rank [427] and many subsequent works that used evolutionary algorithms to optimize and evaluate MASs.
In the context of cooperative tasks, evolutionary algorithms play a significant role. Literature [428] considered the
distributed configuration problem in multi-agent robot systems, optimizing the system through a fuzzy system and

32

evolutionary algorithm to enhance cooperative performance. MERL [355] designed a layered training platform, addressing two objectives through two optimization processes. An evolutionary algorithm maximizes sparse team-based
objectives by evolving the team population. Simultaneously, a gradient-based optimizer trains policies, maximizing
rewards for specific individual agents. BEHT [356] introduced high-quality diverse goals into MASs to solve heterogeneous problems, effectively enhancing system generalization. MCAA [357] and some subsequent works [429, 430]
considered improving asymmetric MASs through evolutionary learning. EPC [349] enhanced the generalization and
transfer capabilities of MASs through population evolution. ROMANCE [358] and MA3C [171] used population
evolution to generate adversarial attackers to assist in the training of cooperative MASs, obtaining robust policies.
4.2.5

Robust Cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

The study of robustness in RL has garnered widespread attention in recent years and has made significant
progress [431]. The focus of robustness research includes perturbations to various aspects of agents in RL, such as
states, rewards, and actions. One category of methods introduces auxiliary adversarial attackers, achieving robustness
through adversarial training alternating between the policy in use and the opponent system [432–435]. Other methods
enhance robustness by designing appropriate regularization terms in the loss function [436–438]. In comparison to
adversarial training, these methods effectively improve sample efficiency. However, these approaches lack certifiable
robustness guarantees regarding the noise level and the robustness between policy execution. In response to this issue,
several verifiable robustness methods have been derived [361, 439–441].
Currently, research on robustness in MARL has started to attract attention [45]. The main challenges lie in the additional considerations required for MASs compared to single-agent systems, including non-stationarity arising from
complex interactions among agents [21], trust allocation [22], scalability [24], etc. Early work aimed to investigate
whether cooperative policies exhibit robustness. For instance, targeting a cooperation policy trained using the QMIX
algorithm, literature [442] trained an attacker against observations using RL. Subsequently, literature [45] conducted
a comprehensive robustness test on typical MARL algorithms such as QMIX and MAPPO in terms of rewards, states,
and actions. The results further confirmed the vulnerability of MASs to attacks, emphasizing the necessity and urgency of research on robust MARL. Recent progress in enhancing robustness in MARL includes work focusing on
learning robust cooperative policies to avoid overfitting to specific teammates [46] and opponents [443]. Similar to robust SARL, R-MADDPG [47] addressed the uncertainty of the MAS’s model, establishing the concept of robust Nash
equilibrium under model uncertainty and achieving optimal robustness in multiple environments. Addressing the issue
of perturbed actions in some agents within MASs, literature [48] introduces a heuristic rule and relevant equilibrium
theory to learn a robust cooperative policy for MASs. The robustness of multi-agent communication has also received
attention in recent years. Literature [444] designed a filter based on Gaussian processes to extract valuable information from noisy communication. Literature [445] studied the robustness of multi-agent communication systems at the
neural network level. Literature [49] modeled multi-agent communication as a two-player zero-sum game and applies
PSRO technology to learn a robust communication policy. Works such as ARTS [446] and RADAR [447] considered
the resilience of MASs and study the recovery capabilities of cooperative MARL tasks in the face of environmental
changes.
Recently, addressing the challenge of cooperation robustness in dynamically changing environments, literature [358]
proposes the ROMANCE algorithm, an robust cooperation algorithm against evolutionary auxiliary adversarial attackers. Literature [169] introduces the MA3C framework for adversarial robust multi-agent communication training
through population adversarial training. Literature [171] proposes the CroMAC method for verifiable robust communication with a multi-view information perspective. Research on perturbed multi-agent observations is discussed in
literature [359], and literature [448] considers learning a robust policy against state attacks in MASs.
4.2.6

Multi-Objective (Constrained) Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Multi-objective optimization [449] refers to the existence of multiple objective functions in an optimization problem,
requiring simultaneous consideration of the optimal solutions for each objective. In multi-objective optimization
problems, conflicts may arise between different objective functions, meaning that improving one objective function
may lead to the deterioration of another. Therefore, a balance needs to be struck between different objective functions
to find a compromise point, also known as the Pareto optimal solution set.
In RL, multi-objective optimization is frequently employed. For example, in multi-objective RL, agents need to learn
Pareto optimal policies across multiple objectives [450–453]. Similarly, in MARL, some works introduce multiobjective learning problems, generally modeled as Multiobjective MASs (MOMAS) [454], where reward functions
for different objectives may conflict. Literature [455] considered the relationship between individual preferences and
shared goals in MASs, modeling it as a multi-objective problem. The results indicate that a mixed processing approach
achieves better performance than solely considering a single objective. Literature [456] exploreed how communication

33

and commitment help multi-agents learn appropriate policies in challenging environments. Literature [457] addressed
the multi-objective opponent modeling problem in general game problems, accelerating policy learning through multiobjectives.
On another note, recent works focus on single-agent safe RL [458, 459] and multi-agent safe RL [274]. These constrained problems in RL settings can be modeled as Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDP). In MARL,
literature [274] proposed testing environments, Safe MAMuJoCo, Safe MARobosuite, and Safe MAIG, for multiagent tasks. They further propose safe MARL algorithms MACPO and MAPPO-Lagrangian. Literature [460] studied
online secure MARL in constrained Markov games, where agents compete by maximizing their expected total utility
while constraining the expected total reward. Literature [461] investigated safe MARL, where agents attempt to jointly
maximize the sum of local objectives while satisfying their individual safety constraints. CAMA [360] explored safety
issues in multi-agent coordination. Literature [462] considered robustness and safety issues in MASs when states are
perturbed. Additionally, some works consider safety in MARL based on barrier protection [206,362,363], or combine
safety in MASs with control techniques [361, 463].

Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Distributional RL has made significant progress in various domains in recent years [464]. Classical value-based
RL methods attempt to model the cumulative return using expected values, represented as value functions V (s) or
action-value functions Q(s, a). However, complete distribution information is largely lost in this modeling process.
Distributional RL aims to address this issue by modeling the distribution Z(s, a) of the random variable representing
the cumulative return. Such methods are also applied to multi-agent cooperation tasks. To alleviate the randomness in
the environment caused by local observability, DFAC [364] extended the reward function of a single agent from a deterministic variable to a random variable. It models the mixing function of QMIX-type algorithms as a distributional
mixing function, achieving excellent cooperation results in various challenging tasks. Furthermore, to mitigate the
uncertainty introduced by the stochasticity of reward functions in multi-agent cooperation tasks, RMIX [365] utilized
risk-based distributional techniques, such as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), to enhance the algorithm’s cooperation
ability. The algorithm innovatively introduces risk assessment based on the similarity of agent trajectories, with theoretical justification and experimental results verifying its effectiveness. ROE [160] proposed a risk-based optimistic
exploration method from another perspective. This method selectively samples distributions to effectively improve the
exploration efficiency of MASs.
In addition to distribution-based multi-agent cooperation algorithms mentioned above, other works explore various aspects, such as reward evaluation based on value distribution [366], efficient and adaptive multi-agent policy learning in
general game problems [368], risk decoupling learning in the multi-agent learning process [367], and risk management
based on game theory [369]. Although these works have achieved certain results in various environments, considering
the unknown risks in real environments, exploring how to deploy multi-agent policies in real environments, automatically identifying environmental risks, and adjusting cooperative policies accordingly is one of the future research
directions.
4.2.8

Ad-hoc Teamwork

Ad-hoc teamwork (AHT) [50] aims to endow intelligent agents with the ability to efficiently collaborate with untrained
agents, creating autonomous agents capable of effective and robust coordination with previously unknown teammates [370]. Early work assumed knowledge of the cooperative behavior of teammates for learning agents [370, 465].
Subsequent research gradually relaxed this assumption, allowing autonomous learning agents to be unaware of teammates’ behaviors during interaction. Some approaches design algorithms to predict corresponding teammates’ policies
by observing their behaviors, promoting coordination in AHT [466–469]. Other works attempted to enhance cooperation among teammates in AHT through effective communication methods [470]. While these approaches improve
coordination performance to some extent, they assume that cooperating teammates are in a closed environment, maintaining a constant number and type of teammates in a single trajectory. Open AHT has been proposed and studied
to address this limitation [371], where GPL [373] tackles changes in teammate types and quantities at different time
points through a graph neural network.
Early AHT work generally considered agents in globally observable environments. Recent efforts extend this setting to scenarios with locally observable scenes. ODITS [372] evaluated other teammates’ behaviors using mutual
information-optimized regularization, enabling trained autonomous agents to infer teammate behavior from local observations. In contrast to previous studies, a method is proposed to address open-ended temporary teamwork in
partially observable scenarios [471]. TEAMSTER [376] introduced a method to decouple world model learning from
teammate behavior model learning. Additionally, some work explores various aspects, including AHT problems with
attackers [472], few-shot interaction coordination [52], and teammate generation coverage in AHT [374, 375] .

4.2.9

Zero (Few)-Shot Coordination

Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a concept proposed in recent years for cooperative multi-agent tasks, aiming to train
agents to cooperate with unseen teammates [51]. Self-play [473, 474] is one means of effectively improving coordination, where agents continuously enhance their coordination abilities through self-coordination. However, agents
generated in this way may lack the ability to collaborate with unseen teammates. Literature [475] further refined
the problem, involving introducing sequence-independent training methods to alleviate suboptimality. To address potential overfitting to specific teammate behavior styles resulting from training with a single teammate, other methods,
such as Fictitious Co-Play (FCP) [377,476] and co-evolution with teammate populations [379], have achieved success.
Some works leverage few-shot techniques to cope with multimodal scenarios and have shown effectiveness [353,380].
Recent research [477] evaluates and quantifies the capacity of various ZSC algorithms based on the action preferences
of collaborating teammates.
Beyond these efforts, ZSC research includes diversity metrics [378,478], design of training paradigms [377,379,475],
equivariant network design [479], coordination enhancement based on policy similarity evaluation [480], general
scenarios of ZSC problems [481], ZSC improvement based on ensemble techniques [481], studies on human value
preferences [382], diverse teammate generation [381], and policy coevolution in heterogeneous environments [379].
Additionally, few-shot adaptation has found widespread use in single-agent meta-RL [482–484], and Few-shot Teamwork (FST) [52] explores generating agents that can adapt and collaborate in unknown but relevant tasks. CSP [380]
considered a multi-modal cooperation paradigm and develops a few-shot collaboration paradigm that decouples collaboration and exploration strategies, it collects a small number of samples during policy execution to find the optimal
policy head. The study in [383] found that current performance-competitive ZSC algorithms require a considerable
number of samples to adapt to new teammates when facing different learning methods. Accordingly, they propose
a few-shot collaborative method and validate the algorithm’s effectiveness on Hanabi. Macop [354] considered the
adaptability of strategies under changes in cooperative objects between rounds and proposes a highly compatible
collaboration algorithm for arbitrary teammates, significantly improving the collaboration algorithm’s generalization
ability, showing astonishing coordination effectiveness.
4.2.10

Human-AI Coordination

The capability to enable efficient collaboration between agents (robots) and humans has been a longstanding goal
in artificial intelligence [485, 486]. The concept of human-AI coordination [258] has a relationship with HumanAI Interaction (HAI) [487] or Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) [488]. The purpose of human-AI coordination is to
enhance collaboration between human participants and agents to accomplish specific tasks. Benefiting the strong
problem solving ability, cooperative MARL can be employed to improve human-AI coordination capabilities for
different human participants.
In contrast to the previously mentioned ZSC issue, human-AI coordination considers human participants as cooperative entities. Although research has shown that, in some environments, it might be possible for intelligent agents
to collaborate with real humans without training on human data [377], in scenarios where subtle features of human
behavior critically impact the task, generating effective collaborative strategies is impossible without human data.
For the intelligent agents to be trained, one approach is to directly encode teammates with human behavioral styles
through prior bias [475, 489, 490]. Another approach involves training the agents to varying degrees using data collected from interactions with real humans. Some methods combine hand-coding human behaviors based on prior bias
with optimizing agents using data from human interactions [491–493].
However, these methods make strong assumptions about the patterns of human behavior during testing, which are
often unrealistic. In response to this issue, a series of methods have emerged to learn models of human behavior
and compute the best responses to them, facilitating human-AI coordination [384]. In the realm of human-aided
collaboration, some methods are exploring alternative perspectives, such as studying task scenarios preferred by humans [382], promoting human-machine coordination through offline data [385], developing technology for human-AI
mutual cooperation [386], exploring leadership and following technologies in human-machine coordination [494],
zero-shot human-AI coordination [495], Bayesian optimization-based human-AI coordination [496], and setting up
human-machine collaboration environments [497]. Although these works have made some progress in human-aided
collaboration, several challenges persist in this direction. For instance, there is a lack of convenient and effective testing environments; most work is primarily conducted on Overcooked [258], which has a limited number of agents and
overly simple scenarios. Additionally, some studies mainly validate in third-party non-open-source environments like
custom-made robotic arms, posing challenges in developing versatile testing environments suitable for various task
requirements and human participants, as well as designing more efficient algorithms. On the other hand, approaches
such as human value alignment [498,499], and human in-the-loop training [500] could be potential solutions to address
these issues in the future.

4.2.11

Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models

The development of large models, especially large language models [501], has gained widespread attention and application in various fields in recent years. Some recent works are exploring universal decision-making large models [502, 503] and applying them in different contexts. In SARL tasks, research works like GATO [504], DreamerV3 [505], and DT [506] have achieved surprising results in many task scenarios. These works leverage the powerful
expressive capabilities of existing technologies such as Transformer [96, 507]. On the other hand, some recent works
are attempting to learn universal decision-making large models for MASs. For example, MADT [344] promotes research by providing a large-scale dataset and explores the application of DT in MARL environments. MAT [32]
studies an effective large model method to transform MARL into a single-agent problem, aiming to map the observation sequences of agents to optimal action sequences, demonstrating superior performance in multiple task scenarios
compared to traditional methods. Addressing the information of entities in multi-agent environments, literature [388]
proposed MAGENTA, a study orthogonal to previous time-series modeling. MADiff [389] and DOM2 [508] introduced generative diffusion models to MARL, promoting collaboration in various scenarios. SCT [509] accelerates
multi-agent online adaptation using a Transformer model. Literature [510] constructed a humanoid multi-agent environment, "West World," to simulate and test MASs in large-scale scenarios.
Additionally, with the development of large language models represented by ChatGPT, some works are attempting
to promote multi-agent collaboration through language models. For instance, EnDi [511] uses natural language to
enhance the generalization ability of MASs. InstructRL [512] allows humans to obtain the desired agent strategy
through natural language instructions. SAMA [390] proposes semantically aligned multi-agent collaboration, automatically assigning goals to MASs using pre-trained language prompts, achieving impressive collaboration results
in various scenarios. HAPLAN [115] utilizes large language model like ChatGPT to bride the gap between human
and AI for efficient coordination. ProAgent [513] introduces an efficient human-machine collaboration framework
that leverages large language models for teammate behavior prediction, achieving the best collaborative performance
in human-machine collaboration tasks. On the other hand, some works apply multi-agent collaboration methods to
enhance the capabilities of large language models [514–516]. However, due to reasons such as complex interactions,
the field of universal decision-making large models for multi-agents is currently less explored. Challenges such as
learning a universal multi-agent decision-making large model that can generalize with zero or few shot across various
scenarios or quickly adapt to new tasks through fine-tuning are worth researching.

Summary and Prospect

This paper focuses on the development and research of cooperative MARL, progressing from classical closed environments to open environments that align with real-world applications. It provides a comprehensive introduction to
reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. Summarizing different research directions, it extracts and condenses the key research focuses
on MARL in classical environments. Despite the success of many closed-environment MARL algorithms based on
the closed-world assumption, their application in the real world remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed
to the lack of targeted research on the characteristics of open environments. There exists a substantial gap between
the current methods and the actual empowerment of daily life. To overcome the challenges posed by the complexity,
dynamism, and numerous constraints in open environments, future research in cooperative MARL could address the
following aspects. This will trigger more attention and exploration of MARL in open environments, enabling better
application of cooperative MASs in real-world settings to enhance human life.
• Solutions of Multi-Agent Coordination Issues in Classical Closed Environments: Algorithms for Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in classical environments serve as the foundation for transitioning
to open environments. Improving the coordination performance in closed environments enhances the broader
applicability potential of these systems. However, challenges persist in large-scale scenarios with numerous
intelligent agents, such as efficient policy optimization [517], and balancing the relationship between distributed and centralized aspects during training and execution. These issues require careful consideration and
resolution in future research.
• Theoretical Analysis and Framework Construction in Open Environments: Open environments present
more stringent conditions and greater challenges compared to closed ones. While some efforts have utilized
heuristic rules to design the openness of machine learning environments [38], the establishment of a comprehensive framework, including a well-defined concept of openness in multi-agent coordination, definitions of
environmental openness, and the performance boundaries of algorithms, is a crucial area for future research.
• Construction of Testing Environments for Cooperative MASs in Open Environments: Despite ongoing research on robustness in open environments for cooperative MARL, benchmark testing often involves

36

modifications in classical closed environments. These approaches lack compatibility with various challenges
posed by different open-ended scenarios. Future research could focus on constructing testing environments
that evaluate eleven identified aspects, providing a significant boost to the study of cooperative MASs in open
environments.
• Development of General Decision-Making Large Language Models for Multi-agent Systems in Open
Environments: Large models, especially large language models [501], have garnered attention and applications in various fields. Some works explore decision-making large language models in multi-agent settings [503,518], yet there is still a considerable gap in research. Future investigations could focus on learning
universal decision-making large language models for MASs that generalize across diverse task scenarios,
achieving zero or few-shot generalization, or rapid adaptation to unknown task domains through fine-tuning.
• Application and Implementation of Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Real-world
Scenarios: While the efficient cooperative performance of MARL in classical environments holds great
application potential, most studies are limited to testing in simulators or specific task scenarios [519]. There
is still a considerable distance from real-world social applications and current needs. The primary goal of
research in cooperative MARL in open environments remains the application of algorithms to human life
and the promotion of societal progress. In the future, exploring how to safely and efficiently apply MARL
algorithms in areas such as large-scale autonomous driving, smart cities, and massive computational resource
scheduling is a topic worthy of discussion.
