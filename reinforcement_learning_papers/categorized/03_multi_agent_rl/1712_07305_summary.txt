**PAPER**: Master-Slave Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE**: Revisiting the Master-Slave Architecture in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID**: 1712.07305v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a master-slave architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning, where a centralized master agent provides high-level instructions to distributed slave agents. The master agent learns to give global guidance, while the slave agents optimize their local actions. The architecture is instantiated with a policy gradient method and evaluated on several challenging multi-agent tasks.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* The paper proposes a novel master-slave architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning.
* The architecture combines the benefits of centralized and decentralized perspectives.
* The method is evaluated on several challenging multi-agent tasks, including traffic junction and combat tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
* The paper provides an analysis of the learned policies and shows that the master-slave architecture can learn effective global strategies.
* The method is compared to other state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning methods, including CommNet, GMEZO, and BiCNet.
