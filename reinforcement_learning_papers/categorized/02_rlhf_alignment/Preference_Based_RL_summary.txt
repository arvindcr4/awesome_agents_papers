**TITLE:** Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a new algorithm, M-AUPO, which selects an assortment that maximizes the average uncertainty of the subset, thereby exploiting the potential benefits of a larger subset size. The algorithm uses online mirror descent to estimate the underlying parameter and selects actions that maximize the estimated reward.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper provides the first theoretical result in online PbRL showing that the suboptimality gap decreases as more options are revealed to the labeler for ranking feedback.
* The analysis removes the OpeB q dependency in the leading term without modifying the algorithm, implying that existing PbRL and dueling bandit methods can similarly avoid this dependence through refined analysis.
* The paper establishes a near-matching lower bound, which provides theoretical support for the upper bounds and highlights the advantage of utilizing ranking feedback over simple pairwise comparisons.
* The authors conduct numerical experiments to empirically validate their theoretical findings, demonstrating the improved performance of M-AUPO over other baselines.
