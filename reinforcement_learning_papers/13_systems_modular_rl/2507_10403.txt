Keywords:
Text-to-Image Retrieval
Remote Sensing
Geospatial Data
Cross-Modal Retrieval
Crisis Management
Land Use and Land Cover

Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for applications like disaster
response and long-term climate monitoring. However, most text-to-image retrieval systems are
limited to RGB data, failing to exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors,
such as the all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the spectral
signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we introduce CrisisLandMark, a new
large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired
with structured textual annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific sources. We
then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining), a novel framework that
uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space
enabling effective text-based retrieval from heterogeneous sources. Our experiments show that
CLOSP achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC@1000 by 54% over existing
models. Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent difficulty
of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge from the optical domain
with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which integrates geographic coordinates
into our framework, creates a powerful trade-off between generality and specificity: while the
CLOSP excels at general semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work highlights that
the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context is essential for unlocking the full
potential of remote sensing archives.

1. Introduction
Satellite remote sensing has become an indispensable tool for monitoring our planet, providing critical data for
many applications, including climate science, environmental management, disaster response, urban planning, and
precision agriculture (Wulder et al., 2022; Torres et al., 2012; Drusch et al., 2012; Goward et al., 2001; Roy et al., 2014).
The large number of satellite missions provides a great volume and diversity of Earth observation data. However,
this availability presents a significant challenge: effectively searching and retrieving relevant imagery from massive,
heterogeneous, and multimodal archives, particularly when the search criteria are expressed in natural language. To
address this challenge, the field of Text-to-Remote-Sensing-Image Retrieval (T2RSIR) has emerged, aiming to bridge

the semantic gap between textual descriptions and the rich visual content of satellite imagery. The task involves
indexing a vast database of images and retrieving a ranked list of the most pertinent examples that match a user’s
natural language query.
The advances in multimodal learning, particularly the adaptation of contrastive learning frameworks like CLIP
(Radford et al., 2021), have driven the recent progress in T2RSIR. Models such as SkyCLIP (Wang et al., 2024), SenCLIP (Liu et al., 2024), and RemoteCLIP (Jain et al., 2024) have demonstrated success in aligning text with remote
sensing imagery. However, these efforts have focused on high-resolution aerial or RGB satellite images. This reliance
on the visible spectrum overlooks the information contained in other modalities and limits their applicability. For
instance, missions like Sentinel-1 provide Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather, day-and-night acquisitions, making it highly effective for land cover mapping, change detection, and infrastructure monitoring (Clasen
et al., 2024; Rege Cambrin and Garza, 2024; Li et al., 2020). Concurrently, multispectral imagery (MSI) from sensors
like Sentinel-2 offers crucial spectral bands beyond RGB that are essential for analyzing vegetation health, water bodies, and soil properties (Thenkabail et al., 2004; Gao, 1996; Huete, 1988). While some models like SatCLIP (Klemmer
et al., 2024) or Llama3-MS-CLIP (Marimo et al., 2025) have begun to leverage multispectral data, they both disregard
the role of SAR data, and SatCLIP aligns it only with geographic coordinates. The full potential of combining these
diverse sensor types into a unified retrieval framework remains largely underexplored.
This points to two gaps in the current state-of-the-art. First, existing T2RSIR corpora are inadequate for developing
and evaluating rich and robust multimodal systems. Many are limited by small scale (e.g., RSICD, RSITMD (Lu et al.,
2018; Yuan et al., 2022)), a dependency on RGB-only aerial imagery, and a lack of rich sensor data like MSI and SAR.
Furthermore, their annotations often consist of unstructured, free-form text from non-experts or language models
(Wang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025), which can introduce ambiguity and limit verifiable quantitative analysis. While

datasets with structured Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) annotations exist (e.g., Sen2Lucas (Jain et al., 2024)), they
lack crisis-related information and still rely on the optical domain. Second, a direct consequence of this data scarcity
is the absence of retrieval models capable of jointly interpreting textual queries, multispectral optical data, and SAR
imagery. No existing architecture creates a shared semantic space that unifies these three modalities, preventing the
development of retrieval systems that can leverage the unique physical information captured by different sensors.
To bridge this gap, we present CrisisLandMark, a new, large-scale T2RSIR corpus of over 647,000 image-text
pairs from the Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) missions. Our corpus is enriched with structured, machinereadable annotations for LULC and crisis events, derived from authoritative sources like CORINE Land Cover (Büttner
et al., 2017) and Dynamic World (Brown et al., 2022). This provides an unambiguous foundation for training and
evaluation. Its characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Additionally, to leverage this rich dataset, we propose
CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining), a novel multimodal architecture designed to align textual
descriptions, optical MSI, and SAR data into a shared latent space. By using the structured text annotations as a
common anchor, CLOSP effectively learns to associate the different visual modalities without requiring temporally
aligned image pairs. Furthermore, we introduce GeoCLOSP, which integrates geographic coordinates into CLOSP to
explore the trade-off between semantic generality and geographic specificity.
Our experimental results on the new CrisisLandMark benchmark demonstrate that CLOSP substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art T2RSIR models. We show that its unified training strategy enables powerful knowledge
transfer, significantly improving the semantic retrieval of challenging SAR imagery. The findings underscore the value
of integrating diverse sensor data to build more powerful, robust, and versatile retrieval systems for large-scale Earth
observation.
In summary, the main contributions of this paper are:
• A new, large-scale T2RSIR corpus, CrisisLandMark, featuring over 647,000 paired examples of multispectral
optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) imagery with structured annotations for land use, land cover, and crisis
events.
• A novel multimodal learning architecture, CLOSP, that is the first to create a shared semantic space aligning
textual descriptions, optical MSI, and SAR imagery, with an extension, GeoCLOSP, that incorporates geographic
locations.
• A comprehensive empirical validation demonstrating CLOSP’s superiority over state-of-the-art baselines and
quantifying the trade-off between semantic retrieval and geographic specificity.

2. Corpus
We present CrisisLandMark, a new corpus composed of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data enriched with textual and
geospatial annotations. Hereafter, we will describe the dataset composition and multimodal sources.

2.1. Data sources
We consider the following datasets as satellite image sources: CaBuAr (Cambrin et al., 2023), MMFlood (Montello
et al., 2022), Sen12Flood (Rambour et al., 2020), QuakeSet (Rege Cambrin and Garza, 2024), and re-BEN (Clasen
et al., 2024).
We align the spatial resolution of these datasets to 10 meters using interpolation and split the images into 120 × 120
patches to be consistent with the re-BEN dataset.
We enrich the source images with a comprehensive set of textual and geospatial annotations. To support crisis
management applications, we incorporated the four specialized datasets (CaBuAr, MMFlood, Sen12Flood, Quakeset),
retaining their original event tags (wildfire, flood, earthquake). For these crisis images, we generated corresponding
LULC annotations (trees, bare, built, crops, grass, water, snow and ice, shrub and scrub, flooded vegetation) by querying the Dynamic World collection. For general LULC coverage in re-BEN, we mapped the high-quality CORINE LC
provided with the dataset as detailed in Section 2.3. Spatial coordinates also characterize all the image patches of every
dataset.
The resulting corpus is primarily composed of general land cover scenes from re-BEN, which constitute 88% of the
images, providing a robust foundation for learning diverse visual semantics. The remaining 12% from the specialized
datasets offer critical examples for crisis retrieval tasks. Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown of the data sources and
their respective contributions of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery.

2.2. Source Images
The corpus is composed of Sentinel-1 GRD and Sentinel-2 L2A products. Three source datasets contain Sentinel-2
data (re-BEN, CaBuAr, and Sen12Flood), whereas four of them include Sentinel-1 data (re-BEN, QuakeSet, MMFlood,
Sen12Flood). Specifically, Sentinel-2 L2A (Level 2A Surface Reflectance) products cover 12 spectral bands in ultrablue, visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared. In contrast, Sentinel-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected) products
have two different polarizations, namely Vertical transmit-Vertical receive (VV) and Vertical transmit-Horizontal
receive (VH).

Sentinel-1 GRD Sentinel-1 GRD products (European Space Agency, 2024a; Torres et al., 2012) are satellite images
captured using radar technology that provides detailed, day-and-night observations of the Earth’s surface. Unlike
regular cameras, radar can see through clouds and in darkness, making it ideal for consistent monitoring in all weather
conditions. GRD products represent the Earth in two dimensions, with each pixel corresponding to a specific area on
the ground. The dataset contains two channels: VV (Vertical transmit, Vertical receive) and VH (Vertical transmit,
Horizontal receive), which refer to the orientation of the radar waves when they are sent out and received back. The VV

polarization is more sensitive to smooth surfaces, while VH is more adequate for detecting rough ones. An example
of a single channel of one of these products can be seen in Figures 2a and 2b.

Sentinel-2 L2A Sentinel-2 Level-2A (L2A) products (Drusch et al., 2012; European Space Agency, 2024b) are highresolution satellite images that provide detailed, true-color views of the Earth’s surface, optimized for environmental
and land monitoring. These images are processed to correct atmospheric effects like haze or cloud cover, making
them more accurate and ready for analysis. They include 13 spectral bands, ranging from visible light (what we see)
to infrared, enabling insights into vegetation health, water quality, soil conditions, and urban development. After the
atmospheric correction, one band was removed, resulting in 12 bands, as seen in Table 3. One example image of
the RGB bands can be seen in Figure 2c paired with VV and VH channels (Figures 2a and 2b) of a Sentinel-1 GRD
product of the same area. The different vision achieved with different spectral bands is shown in Figure 3 in the case
of a wildfire.

2.3. Source text
We design the dataset to support standard land use and land cover applications rather than relying on unstructured
annotations. This is motivated by the fact that LULC applications are typically designed to address the need of institutions for planning regulations and to assess the evolution of certain specific areas regarding ecological aspects and
human activities.
The re-BEN dataset annotations are based on 43 classes, grouped into categories, provided by CORINE LC
(CLC) (Büttner et al., 2017) at its finer level of detail. CLC is a European Environment Agency (EEA) program
that provides consistent, detailed information on land use and land cover across Europe. It is updated periodically (i.e.,
1990, 2000, 2006, 2012, 2018) and helps track land use changes over time, such as urban expansion, deforestation,

or changes in agricultural practices. CLC uses a consistent hierarchical classification system across Europe, ensuring
data comparability between countries with a minimum mapping unit of 25 hectares. Data are primarily gathered using
satellite imagery but are cross-checked with ground observations and other sources to ensure accuracy. However, CLC
is geographically limited to Europe and updated too infrequently for global crisis analysis.
Since CORINE is limited to specific years and only available for Europe, we enrich the four crisis-event datasets
(that cover different years and areas than CORINE) with the 9 LULC classes of Dynamic World (DW) (Brown et al.,
2022) (i.e., Water, Trees, Grass, Flooded Vegetation, Crops, Shrub and Scrub, Built area, Bare Ground, Snow), which

Page 7 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

are contained in CORINE categories. The crisis annotation is taken from the original dataset. Dynamic World is
a high-resolution, near-real-time global land cover system developed by Google, leveraging deep learning models
and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. It provides 10-meter spatial resolution land cover classifications of the entire globe,
making it applicable to diverse ecosystems and regions. Unlike traditional datasets, it offers frequent updates, enabling
the detection of rapid and fine-scale land cover changes. The crisis datasets also contain special keywords to denote
burned area, earthquake damaged, and flooded area. To create a unified and scalable label space, we harmonized all
annotations using the 9-class system from DW. Thanks to its near-real-time global coverage, it is ideal for analyzing
diverse ecosystems and detecting rapid land cover changes. With this solution, we map the higher quality of CLC
annotation to the same classes of DW. The description and distribution of the classes can be found in Table 4. The
mapping is detailed in Section C.

Data splits We divide the resulting dataset into a training set (20% of the total) for training our model and a corpus for
retrieval (80% of the total). To ensure the same label distribution, we employ a stratified multi-label sampling (Sechidis
et al., 2011). According to the 𝜒 2 test, the two distributions of labels are similar with 𝑝 ≈ 1.0. Therefore, the training
split can effectively align models to the task of interest.

2.4. Queries
We define the query set by taking every unique combination (with length from 1 to 12) of one or more labels that
co-occur in at least one image within our corpus. This process resulted in a total of 2,047 distinct multi-label queries.
We define a graded relevance 𝑟𝑒𝑙 based on the IoU between the query labels 𝐿𝑞 and the image labels 𝐿𝑖 to provide a
more fine-grained evaluation:

𝑟𝑒𝑙 = 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 10 ⋅

)

|𝐿𝑞 ∪ 𝐿𝑖 |

For binary relevance operators (e.g., precision and recall), we consider a threshold of 5 for defining a relevant item.
The distribution of relevance scores and relevant images per query is shown in Figure 4.

3. Methodology
We present a new contrastive learning architecture, Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining (CLOSP), to
address the T2RSIR task on the newly proposed corpus.
The remainder of this section is organized as follows. Section 3.1 formulates the task, whereas Sections 3.2 and 3.3
respectively describe CLOSP and its variant that also leverages geospatial data (GeoCLOSP).

3.1. Task definition
Let 𝐷 be a large-scale remote sensing corpus where each item 𝑖 ∈ 𝐷 consists of a satellite image and its associated
metadata. A key characteristic of this task is the focus on imagery beyond the visible spectrum, where an image 𝑖
can be a multispectral optical product (e.g., from Sentinel-2) or a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) product (e.g., from
Sentinel-1). Each image 𝑖 is described by a set of structured textual annotations, 𝐿𝑖 , representing its land cover, land

Figure 5: The CLOSP model aligns textual descriptions with SAR and optical satellite images. For a batch of 𝑁
elements (𝑀 SAR and 𝑀 MSI), one modality—either SAR or optical—is selected for each element of the batch, and the
corresponding image embeddings are paired with their associated textual embeddings. The model is trained to maximize
alignment for these positive pairs (represented by white cells in the matrix) while ensuring that negative pairs, formed by
combining textual and image embeddings from different items within the batch (represented by grey cells in the matrix),
are effectively separated. GeoCLOSP extends the CLOSP architecture by incorporating a location encoder, which aligns
the geographical coordinates of an item with the corresponding satellite image, in parallel with the image-text alignment.

use, and any relevant crisis events. Let 𝑄 be the query space, where a query 𝑞 ∈ 𝑄 is composed of a set of one or more
labels, 𝐿𝑞 , from a predefined vocabulary (e.g., {“water”, “trees”, “burned area”}).
The Text-to-Remote-Sensing-Image Retrieval (T2RSIR) task aims to learn a relevance scoring function, 𝑓 ∶ 𝑄 ×
𝐷 → ℝ, that quantifies the semantic relevance of a candidate image 𝑖 to a given query 𝑞. The relevance is determined
by the thematic alignment between the query labels 𝐿𝑞 and the image’s labels 𝐿𝑖 . The ultimate objective is to leverage
this function, for any given query 𝑞, to retrieve and return a ranked list of the top-𝑘 images from the corpus 𝐷 that
maximize the relevance score 𝑓 (𝑞, 𝑖).
For instance, given a query constructed from the labels (e.g., “forest, burned area”), the retriever should return a
ranked list of satellite images of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data that align with the textual description based on their
relevance to the input query (see Figure 1).

3.2. The CLOSP architecture
The CLOSP architecture is a contrastive learning network whose training schema is depicted in Figure 5. It employs three different encoders, one for text, one for Sentinel-1 (SAR) data, and one for Sentinel-2 (optical) data. The
encoders are trained to project their output representations into a shared latent space, aligning text with satellite imD. Rege Cambrin et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 10 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

agery associated with the same item. Due to differences in satellite configurations, aligned images for the two visual
modalities (i.e., SAR and optical) are rarely available. For example, the mean revisit time for a given area is 12 days
for Sentinel-1 and 10 days for Sentinel-2. Thus, finding paired images for both modalities of the same area with a close
timestamp, e.g., within the same day, is often not possible.
To overcome this limitation, we align textual information simultaneously with both visual modalities during training, but without enforcing any direct alignment between the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images themselves. In this way,
the text also acts as an anchor, linking each image modality independently within a shared latent space.
During a training iteration, the text encoder generates a textual embedding for each of the 𝑁 elements (𝑀 SAR and
𝑀 MSI) in the current batch. Then, each image element (either SAR or MSI) is processed by the corresponding vision
encoder to produce visual embeddings. Finally, following the CLIP pretraining strategy and employing symmetric
cross-entropy loss (see Equations (2) and (3)), the textual and visual embeddings corresponding to the same item are
simultaneously aligned (represented as white cells in the matrix in Figure 5) while being separated from all other
elements (depicted as grey cells in Figure 5). The total loss 𝐿 is presented in Equation (4).

Where 𝑁 is the number of image-text pairs in a given batch. The vectors 𝐢𝑘 and 𝐭𝑘 represent the embeddings for the
𝑘-th image and its corresponding text caption, respectively. The parameter 𝜏 is a learnable temperature hyperparameter
that scales the logits before the softmax operation.

3.3. The GeoCLOSP architecture
Unlike natural images, geospatial imagery is inherently associated with geographic coordinates. Ideally, image embeddings within the same region should exhibit similarities. To also consider the geographical position of the satellite
images, we propose GeoCLOSP, an extension of the CLOSP architecture tailored to align geographical coordinates
with the visual modality. Inspired by SatCLIP (Klemmer et al., 2024), we utilize a Sinusoidal Representation Network
(SIREN) (Sitzmann et al., 2020) and spherical harmonic (SH) positional encoding (Rußwurm et al., 2024) as a location encoder to embed the geographic coordinates associated with each image-text pair. The training schema, shown
in Figure 5, builds upon the standard CLOSP alignment of text and visual modalities while introducing the alignment

Page 11 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

of image and location embeddings (see Equations (5) and (6)). This dual alignment ensures that images with similar
textual content share similar representations, and that images geographically close to each other also exhibit similarity.
The loss 𝐿𝑔 follows the previous definition with two additional components as shown in Equation (7).

4. Experiments
In this section, after introducing the baseline methods, empirical settings, and performance metrics, we discuss the
main experimental results achieved by CLOSP, GeoCLOSP, and the state-of-the-art models on the newly proposed
corpus.

4.1. Baselines
We compare the performance of CLOSP with that of CLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021; Radford et al., 2021), SkyCLIP
(Wang et al., 2024), RemoteCLIP (Liu et al., 2024), SenCLIP (Jain et al., 2024), and Llama3-MS-CLIP (Marimo et al.,
2025) (named Llama3-CLIP for simplicity) on the CrisisLandMark corpus. To the best of our knowledge, these models
are the latest and best-performing T2RSIR models. We also fine-tune them on the training set of our dataset (hereafter
we denote them as <ModelName>-T). This provides an overview of the contribution of other spectral and radiometric
information compared to RGB only. We also trained two specialized models (Text-SAR and Text-MS) to highlight the
benefits of the unified space: we refer to the evaluation of these models together as BiCLIP. We also trained a CLOPSRGB model using an RGB encoder for Sentinel-2 and a False Color encoder for Sentinel-1 to additionally highlight
the limitations of the interactions between RGB and SAR. Additionally, we provide a dummy baseline for each set of
experiments. We provide CLOSP with three different backbones: ResNet-50 (CLOSP-RN), ViT-Small (CLOSP-VS),
and ViT-Large (CLOSP-VL). All the specific settings regarding the analyzed models’ composition and efficiency are
reported in Table 5.

4.2. Training Settings
When testing existing approaches, since they can deal with RGB only (i.e., three channels), we extracted the RGB
bands from Sentinel-2 (originally 12 channels), and we created a false-color composite (European Space Agency,
2024a) from Sentinel-1 channels (originally two channels). We fine-tune all models for 30 epochs, with batch size 64,
Adam optimizer, cosine annealing learning rate scheduler with warmup, and maximum learning rate 1e-4. We leverage
pre-trained encoders: a vision encoder from SSL4EO (Wang et al., 2023), a text encoder from SentenceTransformers
(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), and a location encoder from SatCLIP (Klemmer et al., 2024). GeoCLOSP and specialized models (Text-SAR and Text-MS) are based on ResNet-50 for simplicity, faster training, and reduced risk of
underfitting compared to ViT models.

4.3. Text-to-Image Retrieval
In this section, we present the metrics used for retrieval evaluation, the retrieval settings, and the empirical results.

4.3.1. Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate the retrieval performance in terms of Recall (R), Precision (P), and normalized Discounted Cumulative
Gain (nDCG) Manning et al. (2008). We experiment with common cutoff levels 𝐾 ∈ {10, 50, 100, 1000} to balance
retrieval efficiency and common user needs. nDGC provides the most comprehensive evaluation for graded relevance.
For the evaluation of precision and recall, we use a standard relevance threshold of 5 (i.e., IoU of 0.5). The random
baseline performance is based on analytical computation: for each query, 𝑅@𝐾 = 𝐾∕|𝐷|, 𝑃 @𝐾 = 𝑅𝑞 ∕|𝐷| and
∑𝐾

𝑛𝐷𝐶𝐺@𝐾 = 𝑅𝑚

𝑖=1 1∕𝑙𝑜𝑔2 (𝑖+1)

𝐼𝐷𝐶𝐺@𝐾

, where 𝑅𝑚 is the average relevance score and 𝑅𝑞 is the number of relevant items.

4.3.2. Retrieval Settings
We employ ChromaDB as a vector database to store the normalized embeddings. We use the inner product as the
distance function, which is computationally faster for normalized vectors and is equivalent to cosine similarity. The

D. Rege Cambrin et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 13 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

stored embeddings have the following sizes: 384 for our CLOSP model, 768 for SkyCLIP, and 1024 for SenCLIP and
RemoteCLIP, as in their original configurations. We retrieve 1000 images for each query to balance efficiency and
completeness. In this case, the dummy retriever is the random uniform sampling. To obtain a unified ranking for the
two specialized models, we independently retrieve the images, apply min-max normalization to the scores from each
model, and merge them, keeping only the top 1000 for a fair comparison.

4.3.3. Results
The text-to-image retrieval performance of our proposed models against several baselines is detailed in Table 6.
Note that due to the large number of relevant items for some queries, a perfect Recall@1000 score is not always reachable. However, the relative differences demonstrate, in any case, the model’s capabilities. To confirm the observations,
we performed a Friedman test followed by a Conover post-hoc test for multiple tests for statistical significance (p <
0.01) (Demšar, 2006; Conover, 1998).
Among the original, non-finetuned models, only SenCLIP provides a competitive solution, outperforming the
dummy baseline. However, after being fine-tuned on the CrisisLandMark training set, the baselines show divergent
behavior. While SkyCLIP-T and RemoteCLIP-T improve significantly (according to the statistical test) upon their
original counterparts, SenCLIP-T’s performance degrades significantly. This result may be due to overfitting. Consequently, SkyCLIP-T emerges as the strongest baseline competitor.
Our CLOSP family of models significantly (according to the statistical test) outperforms all baselines (including BiCLIP and CLOSP-RGB) across every evaluated metric. The top-performing model, GeoCLOSP, achieves an
nDCG@1000 of 57.76%, representing a nearly 20-point absolute improvement over the best baseline, SkyCLIP-T
(37.88%).
This demonstrates the significant advantage of our unified architecture. It is also important to note that while
CLOSP-VL employs a much larger backbone than the other variants, it provides only marginal gains. CLOSP-RN and
CLOSP-VS do not exhibit a statistically significant difference from each other in terms of recall and precision. Some
visual examples are shown in Section B.
To visualize the ranking quality at various cutoffs, Figure 6 shows the nDCG and Precision curves for our CLOSPRN and GeoCLOSP (which shares the same backbone) against the strongest baseline and the dummy predictor. The
plots clearly illustrate that our models maintain a consistently higher performance across all values of k.

4.4. Text-to-Image Retrieval by Modality
To isolate and understand the contribution of each visual modality, we evaluated our models on the Sentinel-1
(SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) portions of the corpus separately. For this analysis, each specialized model of BiCLIP
was evaluated only on its corresponding data subset (e.g., Text-SAR on Sentinel-1 images). Our unified CLOSP models

were also evaluated on each subset individually to enable a direct, per-modality comparison.

4.4.1. Results
The retrieval performance of our unified models compared to specialized baselines for each modality is presented
in Table 7. The findings highlight the significant advantages of our joint training approach, particularly for the more
challenging Sentinel-1 data. CLOSP-RGB does not provide comparable results for either Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1, so
we focus our comparison on the best baseline, i.e., BiCLIP.

D. Rege Cambrin et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 15 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

For Sentinel-1 retrieval, all CLOSP variants dramatically outperform the specialized BiCLIP baseline. Our best
variant, CLOSP-VL, achieves an nDCG@1000 of 55.65%, which is +18 absolute improvement over BiCLIP’s 37.35%.
This result provides strong evidence that the unified architecture facilitates a cross-modal knowledge transfer, where
rich semantic concepts learned from the easier-to-interpret optical data are leveraged to disambiguate the complex
backscatter signals in the more challenging SAR imagery, even without any direct interactions between the two visual
encoders.
Conversely, for Sentinel-2 retrieval, our models remain highly competitive with the specialized baseline. CLOSPRN, for instance, shows only a marginal performance decrease in nDCG@1000 compared to BiCLIP (54.80% vs
55.72%). A paired t-test confirms that while the gains on Sentinel-1 are statistically significant (p < 0.01), the small
performance decrease on Sentinel-2 is also significant, though minor in magnitude. This result demonstrates that our
unified training strategy provides great gains for the SAR modality at a negligible cost of a minor drop in optical
performance, confirming the value of the joint training paradigm.

4.5. Zero-shot classification
In this section, we analyze the performance of the CLOSP models in zero-shot multilabel classification over the
whole corpus. Similarly to Radford et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2024), we evaluate the “zero-shot” transfer capability
of the model on an unseen dataset (corpus without the training set), instead of testing the model’s generalizability on
unseen object categories. This tests the model’s generalization to new locations and scenes without any fine-tuning
to assess how well the learned semantic representations can be used for direct classification. While some zero-shot
evaluations focus on holding out entire classes, this approach is less suitable for foundational LULC classification. The
selected classes form a comprehensive and interdependent set describing the terrestrial surface; training a model without knowledge of a fundamental class like “water” would inhibit its ability to learn related concepts such as “flooded
vegetation”. Therefore, evaluating the transfer capability to unseen imagery is a more practical and meaningful test in
this domain.

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

4.5.1. Settings
The multilabel classification is performed in a zero-shot fashion, leveraging the embeddings of the model. Given
the text encoder 𝐸𝑡 , the visual encoder 𝐸𝑣 , and the set of 12 class (e.g; water, trees, burned area) keywords 𝐶 =
{𝑐1 , 𝑐2 , ..., 𝑐12 }, the task can be formalized in the following way. For each class keyword 𝑐𝑗 ∈ 𝐶, we generate the class
vector 𝑣𝑗 = 𝐸𝑡 (𝑐𝑗 ). For each image 𝑖 in the corpus 𝐷, we generate the visual embeddings 𝑢𝑖 = 𝐸𝑣 (𝑖). We create a
similarity matrix 𝑆 of shape |𝐷| × 12 computing the cosine similarity between each 𝑢𝑖 and 𝑣𝑗 . A class 𝑐𝑗 is predicted
as present in an image 𝑖 if its similarity score exceeds a threshold 𝑡.
To select a decision threshold 𝑡 for each model in a fair, zero-shot manner that accounts for their different score
distributions, we adopted a global thresholding strategy. After the creation of 𝑆 for a specific model, the mean of this
entire distribution of scores was then used as the single, model-specific classification threshold. While more complex
methods exist, this simple, dynamic threshold was chosen to maintain a strict zero-shot setting without requiring a
validation set.
We compare baselines and all CLOSP proposed models with a dummy classifier that always predicts the two most
frequent classes, i.e., “crops” and “trees”. Additionally, when evaluating the BiCLIP solution, since each specialized
model makes predictions for its image type without item overlapping, we merge the predictions of all dataset elements
before computing the final performances. Finally, given the strong class imbalance, we evaluate the performance using
macro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1-score (F) over the classes.

4.5.2. Results
The results of the zero-shot classification are presented in Table 8. Our proposed CLOSP models demonstrate a
clear advantage over existing baselines. Specifically, CLOSP-VS and CLOSP-RN achieve the highest performance
with macro F1-scores of 41.82% and 41.56%, respectively, outperforming the best baseline model, i.e., SkyCLIP-T
with an F1-score of 32.81%.
An important finding is the effect of the location encoder. The GeoCLOSP model, which incorporates geographical
data, shows no improvement over its location-unaware counterpart CLOSP-RN (41.24% vs 41.56% F1-score). This
suggests that for this semantic classification task, the additional geographic information does not provide a benefit and
may indicate a trade-off between learning semantic and spatial features.
Furthermore, we observe different model behaviors within our proposed family. For instance, CLOSP-VL exhibits
very high precision (62.48%) at the cost of lower recall (37.40%), making it a more conservative classifier, while
CLOSP-RN achieves a much higher recall (82.25%) with more modest precision (35.59%). All models substantially
outperform the dummy classifier baseline, confirming the general effectiveness of the zero-shot approach.
To determine if differences are significant, we performed a Bayesian signed-rank test (Benavoli et al., 2014), which

D. Rege Cambrin et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 17 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

is more suitable than frequentist tests for comparisons with a small number of classes (12 labels) (Benavoli et al., 2017).
CLOSP-VS, the best-performing model in terms of F1-score, is better than all baselines with high probability (> 0.9).
CLOSP-RN achieves the highest recall, surpassing all models (probability larger than 0.9, except for SkyCLIP 0.88),
proving its top-tier performance. CLOSP-VL, which achieves the best precision, also outperforms all baselines with
high probability (> 0.9). Comparisons among the CLOSP variants were less conclusive, underscoring their similarities.

4.6. Spatial Distance Correlation Analysis
In this section, we analyze the correlation between the embedding distances and the corresponding image geographical distances to understand the effects of the location encoder.

4.6.1. Settings
To analyze the relationship, we first drew two disjoint sets of 10,000 images each via uniform random sampling
from the entire corpus. We then created 10,000 pairs by matching the first image from set A with the first from set
B, the second with the second, and so on. For each of these pairs, we computed two distance values: the geographic
distance using the Haversine formula and the embedding distance using the cosine distance (computed as 1 − cosine
similarity) between the embeddings. We analyze Pearson and Spearman correlations to understand both linear and
monotonic relationships.

D. Rege Cambrin et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 18 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

4.6.2. Results
To directly assess the impact of the location encoder, we compare the results from GeoCLOSP against its locationunaware counterpart, CLOSP-RN. For the CLOSP-RN model, we observe a negligible linear correlation (Pearson’s
𝑟 ≈ −0.06, 𝑝 < 0.01) and a weak monotonic correlation (Spearman’s 𝑟𝑠 ≈ 0.13, 𝑝 < 0.01). In contrast, while the
GeoCLOSP model also shows no linear relationship (Pearson’s 𝑟 ≈ −0.04, 𝑝 < 0.01), it achieves a stronger monotonic
correlation (Spearman’s 𝑟𝑠 ≈ 0.34, 𝑝 < 0.01). The relationship between geographical and embedding distances of the
sampled sets of points is illustrated in Figure 7.
This divergence demonstrates that our location encoder successfully introduces a moderate, monotonic structure
into the latent space. The improvement in the Spearman coefficient confirms the effectiveness of our location-aware
training approach. However, the modest absolute correlation value indicates that the embeddings remain primarily
organized by semantic content rather than geographic proximity. This highlights a key challenge and a promising direction for future work: developing novel training strategies to achieve a more balanced representation of both semantic
and geographic features.

4.7. Single classes performance
In this section, we report the performance by class in retrieval (nDCG) and classification (F1-score) for SkyCLIPT, CLOSP-RN, and GeoCLOSP, to better understand their fine-grained differences. In this case, since we do not
report mean results among classes, to determine statistical significance, we performed a bootstrap analysis (Kuhn and
Johnson, 2013; Efron, 1992) with 1000 iterations for each class, applying a Bonferroni correction (Bonferroni, 1936)
for multiple comparisons.
The per-class performance is detailed in Table 9, revealing a clear trade-off between general semantic performance
and specialization on geographic and crisis-related events. While SkyCLIP-T serves as a strong baseline, our statistical

D. Rege Cambrin et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier

Page 19 of 31

CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing

analysis confirms that both CLOSP-RN and GeoCLOSP significantly outperform it across the majority of classes for
both metrics. The statistical analysis confirms that most observed performance differences are significant (𝑝 <
0.01). The primary exceptions where no significant difference was found are:
• For the F1-score, between CLOSP-RN and GeoCLOSP on the “water” and “burned area” classes.
• For the nDCG metric, between CLOSP-RN and GeoCLOSP on “burned area”; between GeoCLOSP and SkyCLIPT on “trees”; and among all three models on the “water” class.
Our primary finding is that, while absolute F1-scores for rare classes are expectedly modest, GeoCLOSP improves
performance on classes where location is a key factor. For crisis events such as earthquake damage and rare geographic
features like snow and ice, GeoCLOSP shows a remarkable improvement in retrieval. Its nDCG score for “earthquake
damage” is 65.5%, whereas the baseline CLOSP-RN completely fails with a score of 0. For “snow and ice”, the nDCG
score similarly improves from 18.47% to 60.9%. These results show that the location encoder introduces crucial
contextual information that visual features alone cannot capture.
Conversely, for common, geographically widespread semantic classes like crops and trees, the baseline CLOSPRN consistently achieves the highest scores in both classification and retrieval. For instance, CLOSP-RN scores an F1
of 84.84% on “trees”, while GeoCLOSP scores 78.95%. This suggests that enforcing a geographic structure slightly
dilutes the model’s performance on these very general semantic concepts.
Interestingly, for some classes, the impact is more nuanced. For burned area and water, the performance between
CLOSP-RN and GeoCLOSP is not statistically significantly different, suggesting that the strong visual and semantic
signals of these classes dominate over the geographic information. The results clearly indicate that the choice between
CLOSP-RN and GeoCLOSP presents a trade-off depending on the user’s application: CLOSP-RN excels at generalpurpose semantic tasks, while GeoCLOSP is a more powerful, specialized tool for location-specific and crisis-related
analysis.

5. Discussion
Our study introduced CrisisLandMark, a novel large-scale corpus for Text-to-Remote-Sensing-Image Retrieval
(T2RSIR), and CLOSP, a multimodal architecture designed to operate on satellite data beyond the visible spectrum.
The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance over existing methods, and this section
discusses the interpretation and implications of these findings.

5.1. Principal Findings and Contributions
The primary finding of this work is that by training a contrastive model on a diverse corpus of multispectral
(Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) imagery, it is possible to substantially outperform state-of-the-art T2RSIR systems

that are primarily designed for RGB data. Our proposed model, CLOSP, achieved a better retrieval and classification
performance than the baselines, confirming that the rich information contained in non-RGB channels is not only useful
but critical for accurately retrieving images based on land cover, land use, and crisis-event descriptions.
A key methodological insight from our experiments is that continual pre-training of an existing vision-language
model like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) is not a prerequisite for high performance in this domain. Our results show that
good performance can be achieved by aligning powerful, independently pre-trained unimodal encoders. By initializing
CLOSP with a vision encoder from SSL4EO and a text encoder from Sentence Transformers, and then training them
jointly with a contrastive objective, we demonstrate a flexible and effective alternative to extending pre-aligned models.
Furthermore, GeoCLOSP highlights the nuanced but critical role of location. We demonstrated that explicitly
encoding geographic coordinates provides a contextual signal for location-dependent phenomena, such as earthquakes
or specific climatic zones (e.g., snow and ice), while also showing that a trade-off exists for more semantically-defined
classes.

5.2. The Synergy of a Unified Optical-SAR Latent Space
One of the most significant results is the demonstrated benefit of jointly training on optical and SAR data within
a unified embedding space. As shown in our modality-specific evaluation (Table 7), the proposed approach improved
retrieval performance for Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery, a data source notoriously difficult for semantic interpretation due
to its different imaging physics compared to optical sensors. This suggests a powerful knowledge transfer mechanism:
the model leverages the clear semantic signatures from Sentinel-2’s multispectral bands (e.g., identifying vegetation or
water) to learn corresponding structural and textural patterns in the Sentinel-1 SAR data, without any direct alignment
strategy (there is no loss between the two vision encoders’ embeddings).

This synergy is crucial for practical applications. It allows for the development of a single, robust retrieval system
that can easily query across different sensor types. An end-user can submit a natural language query, such as “flooded
vegetation”, and retrieve relevant satellite images regardless of whether they are from an optical or SAR satellite. Our
model effectively bridges the gap between the two modalities with an indirect alignment.

5.3. The Trade-off Between Semantic and Geographic Representations
The comparison between CLOSP and GeoCLOSP uncovers a fundamental trade-off in designing foundation models for Earth observation: the balance between semantic content and geographic context. Our results (Table 9) clearly
show that GeoCLOSP excels in retrieving images for classes where location is a key defining characteristic. For instance, its ability to retrieve images of “earthquake damage” (a geographically localized event) and “snow and ice” (a
climatically constrained feature) was superior to the baseline CLOSP. In these cases, the location encoder provides an
essential prior that visual features alone cannot capture.
Conversely, for geographically widespread classes such as “crops” and “trees”, the purely semantic CLOSP-RN
model performed better. This suggests that enforcing a geographic structure on the latent space can slightly “dilute”
the model’s focus on fine-grained visual semantics when the location is not a primary discriminative factor. This
finding implies that the optimal retrieval strategy may depend on the nature of the query. Future systems could potentially employ an adaptive approach, dynamically weighting the influence of the location encoder based on the query’s
geographic specificity.

5.4. Implications for Real-World Applications
The advancements presented in this paper have direct implications for several domains. In crisis management,
the ability to retrieve relevant imagery of events like floods or wildfires is a significant operational advantage. First
responders and analysts can obtain a more complete and timely picture of the situation on the ground simply by knowing the possibly large area that is affected, leaving the search engine to find the exact points affected by the crisis (e.g.,
you may know a wildfire is near San Jose, but leave the engine search for all areas near the city that are affected). Importantly, our integration of SAR data can significantly boost performance in such scenarios, where optical data may
be limited (e.g., due to cloud cover or night-time conditions). For environmental monitoring and urban planning,
CLOSP makes large-scale land cover analysis more accessible. Researchers and policymakers can query vast archives
using simple textual descriptions to track deforestation, monitor urban expansion, or assess agricultural health without
needing to write complex code or manually filter thousands of images. For example, they could retrieve Sentinel-2
images to assess crop health via spectral indices and Sentinel-1 images to monitor changes in field structure or planting/harvesting activities, all through a single, unified system. This democratizes access to valuable Earth observation
data.

5.5. Limitations
Despite the promising results, this study has several limitations that open avenues for future research. First, while
CrisisLandMark is large, its source datasets may introduce geographic biases (e.g., a focus on Europe from the reBEN dataset). Furthermore, our work focused on single-image retrieval. However, many remote sensing applications,
such as change detection and trend analysis, rely on time-series data. A valuable and logical next step is to extend
the CLOSP architecture to a temporal dimension. This would enable novel queries based on dynamic processes,
for instance, allowing users to directly ask for “deforestation” between 2020 and 2024 or “urban growth” over the
last decade. Additional new classes could benefit from a temporal perspective (e.g., deforestation, desertification).
Additionally, our GeoCLOSP model uses a fixed weighting for its semantic and geographic loss components; future
work could explore dynamic or adaptive weighting schemes to better balance these competing objectives based on the
query type.

6. Conclusions and future work
In this paper, we addressed the limitations of existing text-to-image retrieval systems, which are often constrained
to RGB data and cannot leverage the full richness of modern satellite sensors. We introduced CrisisLandMark, a
new, large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) images. The corpus’s key
innovation is its structured textual annotations, which are harmonized from authoritative land cover systems (CORINE
and Dynamic World) and enriched with crisis-event tags. To leverage this resource, we developed CLOSP, a novel
contrastive architecture that aligns text with both optical and SAR data. It uses text as a common “bridge” to create a
unified semantic space from unpaired multisensor imagery, solving a fundamental challenge in satellite data fusion.
Our experiments led to three principal findings. First, by moving beyond the visible spectrum, the CLOSP framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, proving that the rich information in SAR and multispectral
data is crucial for retrieval. Second, we provide strong evidence for cross-modal knowledge transfer: the unified
training strategy allows semantic concepts learned from optical data to improve the interpretation and retrieval of
challenging SAR imagery. Finally, our work uncovers a fundamental and practical trade-off between semantic and
geographic representation. While the baseline CLOSP model is a superior general-purpose semantic retriever, GeoCLOSP becomes a high-performing specialist for location-dependent queries, such as crisis events and rare geographic
features.
This research opens several promising avenues for future work. The most critical next step is the integration of
the temporal dimension, extending our framework to support time-aware queries and the analysis of dynamic environmental processes. Other promising directions include: expanding the CrisisLandMark corpus with more globally distributed data to mitigate geographic bias; exploring adaptive methods to dynamically balance the semantic-geographic

trade-off within GeoCLOSP; and leveraging multimodal large language models to enable more descriptive annotations
and queries.
Ultimately, this work provides both a powerful framework and a valuable resource for building the next generation
of sensor-agnostic retrieval systems, making the wealth of information in global Earth observation archives more
accessible and actionable than ever before.

A. Analysis of Loss Weighting for GeoCLOSP
To analyze the balance between the semantic (𝐿𝑡𝑥𝑡−𝑖𝑚𝑔 ) and geographic (𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑔−𝑙𝑜𝑐 ) loss components, for simplicity,
we can rewrite the loss shown in Equation (7) as 𝐿𝑔 = 𝛼𝐿𝑡𝑥𝑡−𝑖𝑚𝑔 + (1 − 𝛼)𝐿𝑖𝑚𝑔−𝑙𝑜𝑐 , where 𝛼 = 0.5 in this specific case.
We tested 𝛼 values of 0.25 and 0.75, comparing them to the baseline CLOSP-RN, which corresponds to 𝛼 = 1, and
GeoCLOSP (𝛼 = 0.5). The case where 𝛼 = 0 (equivalent to SatCLIP) is omitted from the performance comparison as
it discards the text query entirely, making it unsuitable for text-to-image retrieval. The results, reported in Table 10,
show that an equal weighting of 𝛼 = 0.5 achieves the highest nDCG@1000 score of 57.76. This result outperforms
the semantics-only baseline (𝛼 = 1) and suggests that incorporating geographic context is beneficial. Performance
degrades as 𝛼 shifts heavily towards either extreme, indicating that an even balance provides the optimal trade-off
between semantic relevance and location-based alignment for this task.

B. Visual Examples of Retrieval
We reported some visual examples of retrieved images for increasingly complex queries in Figures 8 to 10. It is
possible that nothing will be retrieved since vector databases (i.e., ChromaDB) use approximated KNN to navigate a
large dataset. Similar images correspond to the same area collected at different timestamps.
