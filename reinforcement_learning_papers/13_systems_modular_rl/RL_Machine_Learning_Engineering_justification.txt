Abstract Snippet:
Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Engineering Agents  arXiv:2509.01684v1 [cs.LG] 1 Sep 2025  Sherry Yang∗ Stanford University  Joy He-Yueya Stanford University  Percy Liang Stanford University  Abstract Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this settin...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "To tackle variable-duration actions, we propose durationaware gradient updates in a distributed asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 14_systems_modular_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as system, distributed, infrastructure, matching the research direction's core themes.
