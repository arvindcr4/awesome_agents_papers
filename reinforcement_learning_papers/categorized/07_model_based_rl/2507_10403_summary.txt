**PAPER:** CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing
**TITLE:** CLOSP: A Unified Semantic Space for SAR, MSI, and Text in Remote Sensing
**ARXIV_ID:** 2507.10403v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces CLOSP, a novel multimodal architecture designed to align textual descriptions with both optical and SAR satellite data. CLOSP uses a contrastive learning approach to create a unified semantic space from unpaired multisensor imagery, solving a fundamental challenge in satellite data fusion.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces CLOSP, a novel multimodal architecture for text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of CLOSP in aligning textual descriptions with both optical and SAR satellite data
* Shows that CLOSP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in text-to-image retrieval tasks
* Highlights the importance of integrating diverse sensor data to build more powerful and robust retrieval systems for large-scale Earth observation.
