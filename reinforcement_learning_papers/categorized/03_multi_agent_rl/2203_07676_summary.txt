**ARXIV_ID:** 2203.07676v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper provides an introduction to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and reviews its application to autonomous mobility scenarios. MARL is a research field that aims to find optimal solutions for multiple agents interacting with each other. The paper explains the basics of MARL, introduces important concepts, and discusses the central paradigms that underlie MARL algorithms.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction to MARL and its application to autonomous mobility scenarios
* Explanation of the basics of MARL, including observability, centrality, heterogeneous vs. homogeneous agents, cooperative vs. competitive, and scalability
* Discussion of the central paradigms that underlie MARL algorithms, including decentralized, credit assignment, communication, and centralized training with decentralized execution
* Review of state-of-the-art methods and ideas in each paradigm
* Survey of applications of MARL in autonomous mobility scenarios, including traffic control, autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and resource optimization.
