**ARXIV_ID:** 2211.16385v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to tackle the problem of microprocessor hardware architecture search. The key idea is to divide the large design space into smaller sub-spaces, each controlled by a separate agent. The agents work together to achieve a global design objective, such as low power or low latency.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* First demonstration of applying MARL to the microprocessor hardware architecture search problem
* MARL formulation consistently outperforms single-agent RL formulations in terms of designing a domain-specific memory controller for multiple memory traces and objective targets
* MARL formulations achieve a mean episodic reward that is approximately 2-60 times more than single-agent formulations
* The approach is scalable and can be applied to more complex computer systems, such as custom hardware accelerators or System-on-Chip (SoC) designs.
