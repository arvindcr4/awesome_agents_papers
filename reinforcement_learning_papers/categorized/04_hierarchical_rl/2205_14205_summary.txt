**TITLE:** ALMA: Hierarchical Learning for Composite Multi-Agent Tasks
**ARXIV_ID:** 2205.14205v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 04_hierarchical_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** ALMA is a hierarchical reinforcement learning method that learns a high-level subtask allocation policy and low-level agent policies simultaneously. It is designed for composite multi-agent tasks, where each subtask's rewards and transitions can be assumed to be independent. ALMA uses a proposal distribution to efficiently explore the large action space of subtask allocations.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* ALMA is a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning method that can efficiently learn complex multi-agent tasks.
* ALMA uses a modular architecture to learn subtask allocation and execution policies, allowing for efficient exploration and exploitation of the action space.
* ALMA is evaluated on two challenging environments, S AVE T HE C ITY and S TAR C RAFT, and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in most settings.
* ALMA's performance is robust to different hyperparameter settings, and it can learn sophisticated coordination behavior in complex environments.
