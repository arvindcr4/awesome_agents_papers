**PAPER:** Reinforcement Learning Enhanced LLMs: A Survey
**TITLE:** Reinforcement Learning Enhanced LLMs: A Survey
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper surveys the current state of reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced large language models (LLMs), focusing on the integration of RL techniques to improve LLM capabilities. The authors discuss the basics of RL, popular RL-enhanced LLMs, and various methods for training reward models and fine-tuning LLMs using RL.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Survey of RL-enhanced LLMs and their applications
* Discussion of popular RL-enhanced LLMs, including InstructGPT, GPT-4, and Claude 3
* Overview of methods for training reward models and fine-tuning LLMs using RL, including RLHF and RLAIF
* Analysis of challenges and opportunities in the field of RL-enhanced LLMs
