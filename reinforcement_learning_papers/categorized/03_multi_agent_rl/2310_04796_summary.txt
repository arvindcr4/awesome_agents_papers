**TITLE:** Accelerate Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Zero-Sum Games with Subgame Curriculum Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2310.04796v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a subgame curriculum learning framework to accelerate multi-agent reinforcement learning in zero-sum games. The framework uses a particle-based sampler to generate subgames and a sampling metric to prioritize subgames based on their learning progress. The method is compatible with any multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm and can be used to learn complex strategies in zero-sum games.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a subgame curriculum learning framework to accelerate multi-agent reinforcement learning in zero-sum games
* Develops a particle-based sampler to generate subgames
* Introduces a sampling metric to prioritize subgames based on their learning progress
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in several zero-sum game environments, including the hide-and-seek game and the Google Research Football environment.
