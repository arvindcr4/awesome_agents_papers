**ARXIV_ID**: 2509.15099v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a digital twin-based cooperative driving system with a roadside unit (RSU)-centric architecture for unsignalized intersections. The system leverages comprehensive bird-eye-view (BEV) perception to eliminate blind spots and employs a hybrid reinforcement learning framework combining offline pre-training with online fine-tuning. The method uses multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with self-attention mechanisms to handle dynamic multi-agent coordination.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* Development of a DT-based MARL framework eliminating blind spots via RSU global perception at unsignalized intersections.
* Introduction of role-specific policy networks with self-attention mechanisms to enable adaptive coordination among connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs).
* Proposal of a hybrid offline-online reinforcement learning method to ensure robust and efficient policy learning.
* Conduct of extensive experiments demonstrating system effectiveness and generalization across diverse scenarios.
