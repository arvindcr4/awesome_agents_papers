Abstract Snippet:
Safety-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Control via Risk-Sensitive Action-Value Iteration and Quantile Regression  arXiv:2506.06954v2 [cs.LG] 7 Dec 2025  Clinton Enwerem, Aniruddh G. Puranic, John S. Baras, and Calin Belta Institute for Systems Research University of Maryland, College Park, United States {enwerem, puranic, baras, calin}@umd.edu  Abstract: Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in high-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration methods reduc...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Safety-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Control via Risk-Sensitive Action-Value Iteration and Quantile Regression  arXiv:2506.06954v2 [cs.LG] 7 Dec 2025  Clinton Enwerem, Aniruddh G."
- "However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies safety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not explicitly integrated into the RL framework."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 05_safe_constrained_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as safety, constrained, cpo, matching the research direction's core themes.
