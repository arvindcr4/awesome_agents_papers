**TITLE**: The Design and Realization of Multi-agent Obstacle Avoidance based on Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID**: Not provided
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes two algorithms, MADDPG-LSTMactor and MADDPG-L, to solve the obstacle avoidance and navigation problem for multi-agent systems. The MADDPG-LSTMactor algorithm combines MADDPG with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to process the hidden temporal message, while the MADDPG-L algorithm simplifies the input of the critic network to improve scalability. The algorithms are tested in several virtual environments, including Obstacle Predator-Prey, Spread, Tunnel, and Simple Tunnel.
