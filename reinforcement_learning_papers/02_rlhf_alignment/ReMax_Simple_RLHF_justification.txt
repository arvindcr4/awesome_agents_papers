Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "ReMax: A Simple, Effective, and Efficient Reinforcement Learning Method for Aligning Large Language Models  Ziniu Li 1 2 Tian Xu 3 4 Yushun Zhang 1 2 Zhihang Lin 1 Yang Yu 3 4 5 † Ruoyu Sun 1 6 2 † Zhi-Quan Luo 1 2  arXiv:2310.10505v4 [cs.LG] 16 May 2024  Abstract  >4 Hyper-parameters related to the Value Model Op mizer States of the Value Model  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is key to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), typically paired with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm."
- "To make RLHF efficient, we present ReMax, which leverages 3 properties of RLHF: fast simulation, deterministic transitions, and trajectory-level rewards."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 02_rlhf_alignment because it explicitly discusses concepts such as human feedback, preference, alignment, matching the research direction's core themes.
