Abstract Snippet:
Mastering Diverse Domains through World Models Danijar Hafner,12 Jurgis Pasukonis,1 Jimmy Ba,2 Timothy Lillicrap1  Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires significant human expertise and experimentation. We present DreamerV3, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 div...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Mastering Diverse Domains through World Models Danijar Hafner,12 Jurgis Pasukonis,1 Jimmy Ba,2 Timothy Lillicrap1  Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence."
- "We present DreamerV3, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 07_model_based_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as model-based, world model, dynamics model, matching the research direction's core themes.
