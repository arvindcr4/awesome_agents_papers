**TITLE:** Mean Field Control (MFC) Approximate Cooperative Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with Non-Uniform Interaction
**ARXIV_ID:** 2203.00035v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning and Human Feedback Alignment)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The authors propose a Mean Field Control (MFC) approach to approximate Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems with non-uniform interaction. They prove that if the reward function is affine, the MFC approach can approximate the MARL problem with an error bound of O(√1/N [ |X | + |U| ]), where N is the number of agents and |X | and |U| are the sizes of the state and action spaces respectively.

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors provide a theoretical framework for approximating MARL problems with non-uniform interaction using MFC.
* They prove that the MFC approach can approximate the MARL problem with an error bound of O(√1/N [ |X | + |U| ]).
* They propose a Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithm to solve the MFC problem with polynomial sample complexity.
* They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments.

Note: The research method is classified as 02_rlhf_alignment, but the paper does not explicitly focus on human feedback alignment. Instead, it focuses on the application of MFC to approximate MARL problems with non-uniform interaction.
