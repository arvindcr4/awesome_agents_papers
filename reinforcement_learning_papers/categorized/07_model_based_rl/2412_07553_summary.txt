**PAPER:** Spontaneous emission in an exponential model
**TITLE:** Spontaneous emission in an exponential model
**ARXIV_ID:** 2412.07553v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper presents a theoretical model to study the phenomenon of spontaneous emission in an exponential model. The model is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which includes an imaginary coupling term and a shift. The authors use the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to investigate the dynamics of the system and calculate the transition and survival probabilities.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors introduce a new scenario where spontaneous emission generates an imaginary coupling and a shift in the off-diagonal Hamiltonian terms.
* They use the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to study the dynamics of the system and calculate the transition and survival probabilities.
* The authors show that the imaginary coupling and the shift enhance the transmission of information for small values in the ground-state population.
* They also demonstrate that the system exhibits exponential decay in populations, but some oscillations appear when the phase is large, indicating information transfer.
* The authors discuss the similarity between the first exponential Nikitin model and the Rabi model when time approaches −∞ in an exponential function.
