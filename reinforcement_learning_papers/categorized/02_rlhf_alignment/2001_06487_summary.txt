**ARXIV_ID:** 2001.06487v3

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory Alignment)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper provides a holistic perspective on algorithms in multi-agent systems, combining reinforcement learning and game theory. It discusses various solution concepts, including Nash equilibrium, and their applications in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The paper also explores fictitious self-play, counterfactual regret minimization, and their integration with deep reinforcement learning. Additionally, it touches on the challenges of multi-agent learning, such as non-stationarity and the need for scalable algorithms. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of current multi-agent learning algorithms and their connections to game theory and reinforcement learning.
