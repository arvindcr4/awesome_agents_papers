**PAPER:** An Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Radio Resource Management
**TITLE:** An Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Radio Resource Management
**ARXIV_ID:** 2501.12991v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes an offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for radio resource management in wireless networks. The framework uses a conservative Q-learning algorithm to optimize the policies of multiple agents in a decentralized manner. The authors evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using numerical simulations and compare it to other baseline models.
