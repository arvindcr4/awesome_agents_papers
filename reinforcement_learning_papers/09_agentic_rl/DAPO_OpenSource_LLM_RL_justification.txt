Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale ByteDance Seed  Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University 3 The University of Hong Kong 4 SIA-Lab of Tsinghua AIR and ByteDance Seed 2  Full author list in Contributions  Abstract Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning."
- "However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 09_agentic_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as agent, tool, web, matching the research direction's core themes.
