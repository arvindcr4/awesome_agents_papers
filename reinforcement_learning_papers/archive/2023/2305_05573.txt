ABSTRACT
Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms
have become popular in the literature since it allows heterogeneous agents to have their own reward functions as opposed to
canonical multi-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP) settings which
assume common reward functions over all agents. In this work, we
follow the existing work on collaborative MARL where agents in a
connected time varying network can exchange information among
each other in order to reach a consensus. We introduce vulnerabilities in the consensus updates of existing decentralized MARL algorithms where some agents can deviate from their usual consensus
update, who we term as adversarial agents. We then proceed to
provide an algorithm that allows non-adversarial agents to reach
a consensus in the presence of adversaries under a constrained setting.

INTRODUCTION

Multi-agent reinforcement learning constitutes a reinforcement learning scenario where multiple agents participate to jointly learn an
optimal policy and where optimality is deﬁned in terms of some
objective [2]. In a collaborative setting, the agents have to work together with a goal to optimize a shared reward metric [12]. Multiagent environments are inherently non-stationary since the other
agents are free to change their behavior as they also learn and
adapt and this makes designing algorithms for MARL more complex that single agent systems. Our model diﬀers from the traditional collaborative and fully co-operative multi-agent systems
in that the agents in our system are heterogeneous and can have
diﬀerent local reward functions. We work on sequential decisionmaking problems in which the agents repeatedly interact with their

environment and try to jointly optimize the long-term reward they
receive from the system, which depends on a sequence of decisions
made by them and the signals shared by other agents in the network.
Existing value-factorized based MARL approaches perform well
in various multi-agent cooperative environments under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) scheme, where
all agents in a team are trained together by the centralized value
network and each agent executes its policy independently [14, 15].
One of the existing issues in such systems is that in the centralized
training process, the environment for the team is partially observable and non-stationary. The observation and action information
of all the agents cannot represent the global states. What follows
is that the existing methods perform poorly and are highly sample
ineﬃcient. In these regimes, regret minimization is a promising
approach as it performs well in partially observable and fully competitive settings. However, it tends to model others as opponents
and thus cannot work well under the CTDE scheme. In our work,
we set out to respect two constraints: ﬁrst, we want the agents to
be fully decentralized even in their training and second, we follow
the model free actor critic type algorithms for our collaborative
MARL setup as opposed to Q-learning type algorithms or centralized training with model based approaches [28].
The major diﬀerence in the kind of algorithms we follow in this
paper with that of CTDE techniques is that our work follows the
studies on consensus based distributed optimization [19] where
the agents exchange parameters instead of their actions and states
with other agents [14]. There is no centralized training and each
agent performs the critic step independently. These consensus based
systems have been popular in many ﬁelds like sensor networks, social learning, co-ordination of vehicles and co-ordinated synchronous distributed optimization to name a few. However, most of
these studies evade the risk of adversaries or agents that deviate
from consensus updates. For example, in studies where humans
participate in decision making and social learning over time [4, 23],
presence of adversarial nodes could disrupt the learning dynamics. The study in [8] showed that a single adversarial agent can
persuade all the other agents in the network to implement policies that optimize an objective that it desires. It then becomes important to answer whether we can modify the existing consensus
based decentralized MARL algorithms to respond to the presence
of malicious agents who deviate from the consensus rule updates
or whether the non-malicious agents can still converge to the optimal solution in the presence of adversaries.
We study the setup where the rewards or the data for the agents
are not corrupted but instead where the adversarial agents do not
follow the consensus updates to obtain a joint optimal policy. We

consider the scenario where there could exist more than a single
adversarial agent in our setup. Section 2 provides the technical preliminaries of our networked MARL setup and Section 3 discusses
the adversarial settings and the adversary aware consensus MARL
algorithm.

DECENTRALIZED NETWORKED MARL

Our work is heavily inﬂuenced by the research on decentralized
multi-agent reinforcement learning done in [31]. The authors develop a consensus based reinforcement learning algorithm in a
fully decentralized and networked setting. We primarily extend
their work in a networked setting where malicious agents are present
under a constrained setup. Our networked multiagent MDP is constructed as follows: we have a state space S shared by all agents
N in a network, such that A𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ |N | is the action of agent 𝑖. Let
Î𝑁
A = 𝑖=1
A𝑖 be the joint action space of all agents. Following
𝑖
this, R : S × A → R is the local reward function of agent 𝑖 and
𝑃 : S × A × S → [0, 1] is the state transition probability of the
MDP. We assume that the states are observable globally in order to
ensure co-operation among agents, but the rewards are observed
locally as a function of the neighbors of the agent. At time 𝑡, an
agent 𝑖 chooses an action 𝑎𝑖𝑡 given state 𝑠𝑡 , following its own local
policy 𝜋 𝑖 : S × A𝑖 → [0, 1], where 𝜋 𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎𝑖 ) represents the probability of choosing action 𝑎𝑖 at state 𝑠. In this setup, the joint policy
Î
of all agents is given by 𝜋 (𝑠, 𝑎) = 𝑖 ∈ N 𝜋 𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎𝑖 ).
For an agent 𝑖, the local policy is parameterized by 𝜋𝜃𝑖 where 𝜃 𝑖 ∈
Î𝑁 𝑖
𝑖
Θ are the parameters and the joint policy is given by Θ = 𝑖=1
Θ.
As is standard in the assumptions of actor-critic algorithms with
function approximation, the policy function 𝜋𝜃𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎𝑖 ) > 0 for any
𝜃 𝑖 ∈ Θ𝑖 . We assume that 𝜋𝜃𝑖 𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎𝑖 ) is continuously diﬀerentiable
with respect to the parameter 𝜃 𝑖 over Θ𝑖 . For all 𝜃 ∈ Θ, the transition matrix of the Markov chain {𝑠𝑡 }𝑡 ≥0 induced by policy 𝜋𝜃 , for
any 𝑠, 𝑠 ′ ∈ S is given by
𝑃 𝜃 (𝑠 ′ |𝑠) =

Õ

(1)

It comes along with the assumption that {𝑠𝑡 }𝑡 ≥0 is irreducible and
aperiodic under any 𝜋𝜃 , and the chain of the state-action pair {(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 )}
has a stationary distribution 𝑑𝜃 (𝑠) · 𝜋𝜃 (𝑠, 𝑎) for all pairs.
Objective of the MARL: The collective objective of the agents
is to collaborate and ﬁnd a policy 𝜋𝜃 such that it maximizes the
average global long term rewards while only utilizing information
𝑖
that is local to the agents in the network. In that context, let 𝑟 𝑡+1
denote the reward received by agent 𝑖 at time 𝑡. Then the goal of
all agents collectively is to optimize the following objectives:

𝑠 ∈ S,𝑎∈ A

where 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎) = 𝑁1 · 𝑖 ∈ N 𝑅𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎) is the globally averaged reward
function. Following this, we have 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎) = E[𝑟 𝑡+1 |𝑠𝑡 = 𝑠, 𝑎𝑡 =
Í
𝑎] where 𝑟 𝑡 = 𝑁1 𝑖 ∈ N 𝑡𝑡𝑖 . In that context of the symbols, the

Policy Gradient with MARL: To develop an algorithm for MARL,
we would apply the policy gradient theorem as mentioned in Theorem 3.1 in [31]. For any 𝜃 ∈ Θ, let 𝜋𝜃 be a policy and 𝐽 (𝜃) denote
the globally averaged return, we deﬁne the local advantage function 𝐴𝑖𝜃 : S × A → R as 𝐴𝑖𝜃 (𝑠, 𝑎) = Q𝜃 (𝑠, 𝑎) − 𝑉˜𝜃𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎 −1 ), where Q𝜃
and 𝐴𝜃 are the corresponding global action-value and advantage
functions and 𝑉˜𝜃𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎 −1 ) is the local value function. The gradient
of the policy is given by

∇𝜃 𝑖 𝐽 (𝜃) = E𝑠∼𝑑𝜃 ,𝑎∼𝜋𝜃 [∇𝜃 𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝜋𝜃𝑖 𝑖 (𝑠, 𝑎𝑖 ) · 𝐴𝑖𝜃 (𝑠, 𝑎)]

3 ADVERSARY AWARE MARL ALGORITHM
3.1 Non Adversarial Setting
We ﬁrst present the existing work under a non-adversarial setting. Here, he actor-critic based consensus algorithm for the MARL
setup is as follows: we consider an agent speciﬁc local version of
the global action-value function 𝑄𝜃 which we denote as Q (𝜔 𝑖 )
where we hide the state, action factors in the function which is
implicit and 𝜔 ∈ R𝑈 , where the dimension 𝑈 is signiﬁcantly less
than the joint state action space. In order to use the policy gradient
theorem discussed in the previous section to improve an agents’
policy, each agent shares its local parameters 𝜔 𝑖 with its neighbors on the network in order to reach an estimate of Q𝜃 that is
consensual among all agents in the network. Such distributed consensus algorithms have been proposed earlier [19] that guarantee
convergence of the local agent functions.

𝑎∈ A 𝜋𝜃 (𝑠, 𝑎)Q𝜃 (𝑠, 𝑎).

In order to introduce the setup behind the MARL environment
where malicious agents are a part of the network, we ﬁrst deﬁne
certain notations based on the setup of consensus based adversarial attacks in [27]. We consider an undirected network N =
𝑉 (𝑁 ), 𝐸 (𝑁 ), where 𝑉 (𝑁 ) = {𝑣1, 1 . . . , 𝑣𝑛 } and 𝐸 (𝑁 ) denotes the
edges connecting pairs of nodes. Note that 𝑣𝑖 is just an exaggerated
notation to denote an agent in a graph as opposed to 𝑖 that we have
used in the previous sections but they refer to the same agent. Denoting K𝑖 as the neighborhood vertices of 𝑖 ∈ 𝑉 (𝑁 ), for any 𝑟 ∈ N,
a subset 𝑆 ⊂ 𝑉 (𝑁 ) is said to be r-local, if |K𝑖 ∩𝑆 | ≤ 𝑟 ∀𝑣𝑖 ∈ 𝑉 (𝑁 )\𝑆.
That is to say, for r-local subset, there are at most 𝑟 nodes in the
neighborhood of any vertex from 𝑉 (𝑁 ) \ 𝑆. For the setup of adversarial attacks in the multi-agent system, we consider the following:
we consider that there are randomly chosen adversarial nodes in
the network such that for each node 𝑣𝑖 , there cannot be more than
𝑔 fraction of its neighbors who are adversaries, where 𝑔 ∈ [0, 1).
This fraction 𝑔 is known to all nodes in the network, however the
regular nodes do not know which or if any of their neighbor nodes
are adversaries. Here we assume that the adversaries are restricted
to form an F-local set , where 𝐹 is a non-negative integer.

Algorithm

The overall actor-critic algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1. In the
actor step, each agent, each agent improves it policy as shown in
Line 14, where 𝛽𝜃,𝑡 > 0 is the stepsize. Note that both the actor and
the critic steps can be executed in a decentralized fashion without
any centralized training. For the consensus step, one important
thing to note that since the agents aim to optimize the globally
averaged reward function 𝑟 , the agents share their local parameters 𝜔 𝑖 with their neighbors and this allows the agents to improve
their current policy using the policy gradient theorem. The parameter sharing involves a consensus update using the weight matrix
𝐶𝑡 = [𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗)] | N |× | N | such that 𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗) is the weight on the message sent by agent 𝑗 to agent 𝑖 at time 𝑡. An important restriction
in our model is that we only consider 𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗) > 0 if agent 𝑖 and 𝑗
are neighbors of each other in the network. Some discussions on
the choice of 𝑐𝑡 (𝑖, 𝑗) is in the later part of this section.
We modify Algorithm 1 in [31] to incorporate co-ordinated responses by regular nodes in the presence of adversaries. At each
𝑗
time step, the regular nodes {𝑣𝑖 } gather 𝜔˜ 𝑡 for all 𝑣 𝑗 ∈ K𝑖 and remove the highest and lowest 𝐹 states and the remaining nodes are
denoted by 𝜏𝑖 (𝑡) ∈ K𝑖 . The consensus action in the actor is then
to aggregate the parameters from the neighbors in 𝜏𝑖 (𝑡). Note that,

these updates are only done by the regular nodes and the adversarial nodes aggregate the weights from the neighbors in any way
they wish. The dynamics of updates by the regular nodes are local
and decentralized since they do not require regular nodes to know
anything beyond the signals sent from their neighbors. As mentioned in [27], when the network N is time-invariant, the eﬀective
neighbor set 𝜏𝑖 (𝑡) is only a function of the states of neighbors of
𝑣𝑖 at time step 𝑡. This ﬁltering is also closely connected to bandit
based ranking of arms where the distribution of the means of the
arms decide which arm would be picked, albeit here instead of picking one arm, the agent selects one or multiple arms [6]. The rest of
the consensus style algorithm in this decentralized environment is
the same as Algorithm 1 in [31].
The standard assumptions for the consensus matrix is deﬁned
in Assumption 4.4 of [31] and while there can be many ways to
deﬁne the weight, one popular way is to consider the notion of
Metropolis weights [29]

4 RELATED WORK
One of the assumptions in the process of social decision making is
that individuals following a learning trajectory (despite each individual having a limited memory) successfully converges to the best
option for the collective population. While individuals participate
in decision making where they associate diﬀerent risk and rewards
in an uncertain environment, they also tend to incorporate beliefs
from their immediate neighbors in a networked environment, a
phenomenon that has played a critical role in co-operative multiagent systems [4]. This begets the question as to how resilient are
these consensus algorithms and how can agents adapt to decentralized training in the presence of malicious agents or adversaries. We
brieﬂy highly some notable studies done previously at the intersection of MARL and
MARL: The ﬁeld of MARL has evolved very rapidly over the past
few years. The collective goal of the multi-agent system is to either reach a stable and consensus state for all agents [7], or solve
a static optimization problem in a distributed fashion[19]. However, competition and collaboration always emerge between autonomous agents that learn by reinforcement over ﬁnite horizons.
Some of the common approaches on modeling and solving cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problems include: (1)
independent learners [10, 13], (2) fully observable critic [16], (3)
value function factorization [26], (4) consensus based RL [3], and
(5) learning to communicate [17].
Decentralized Networked MARL: The challenge with fully cooperative multi-agent systems is that fully cooperative systems
(Dec-POMDPs) are signiﬁcantly harder to solve than single agent
RL problems due to the combinatorial explosion in the joint action state spaces combining all agents. For this reason CTDE have

.

.

become popular. The prevailing MARL paradigm of centralised
training with decentralised execution (CTDE) [25,29,21] assumes a
training stage during which the learning algorithm can access data
from all agents to learn decentralised (locally-executable) agent
policies. CTDE algorithms such as COMA [9] learn powerful critic
networks conditioned on joint observations and actions of all agents.
Other extensions of MADDP include shared experience actor-critic
frameworks [5] for eﬃcient MARL exploration by sharing experience amongst agents as opposed to MADDPG which only reinforces an agent’s own explored actions. There have also been studies conducted on making these RL systems in networked systems
scalabale [20].
Decision making for social systems: There are two broad avenues of research on decision making in interactive environments
considering social systems. The ﬁrst group of studies focus on game
theoretic environments where agents have similar adaptation and
learning abilities and so the actions of each agent aﬀect the task
achievement of the other agents [1, 18, 21]. The payoﬀ of the agents
in these games depend on whether they are purely collaborative
or competitive or a mix. In a recent study on combining Reinforcement Learning with Agent Based Modeling [25], the authors address the self-organizing dynamics of social segregation and explore the space of possibilities that emerge from considering different types of rewards. The second group of studies focuses on
social inﬂuence from other agents as the intrinsic factor for the decision making. Social inﬂuence has been known to be an intrinsic
factor in agents’ choices [23, 24], and in recent studies, there have
been attempts to propose a uniﬁed mechanism for coordination in
MARL by rewarding agents for having causal inﬂuence over other
agents’ actions [11, 30]. Adversarial attacks during training can potentially impact the choices made by agents and impact the consensus algorithms as studied in [8] and this is important to solve since
attacks through social inﬂuence are a common tool for adversaries
[22].

CONCLUSION

In this work, we discussed a simple strategy for agents to mitigate the nuances of adversarial agents in fully decentralized MARL
where the agents are connected via a time varying network. We
relied on the algorithm of [31] and modiﬁed the actor-critic algorithm in the presence of one or more adversaries. We did not
provide a formal argument for the convergence of the consensus
updates with our adversarial framework which we leave as one of
the immediate next steps of this work. A second direction where
this kind of work can be adapted is to use attention based actor
critic algorithms [? ] that modify the action value function by parameterizing it with agent speciﬁc attention weights. We can then
use reward values to optimize for the attention weights over the
time varying network.
