**TITLE:** Empowering Multi-Robot Cooperation via Sequential World Models
**ARXIV_ID:** 2509.13095v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework called Sequential World Model (SeqWM). SeqWM integrates the sequential paradigm into model-based MARL, enabling each agent to plan actions conditioned on the predictions of its predecessors. This design reduces modeling complexity and alleviates the reliance on synchronous communication.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* SeqWM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world quadruped experiments.
* SeqWM enables the emergence of advanced cooperative behaviors such as predictive adaptation, temporal alignment, and role division.
* SeqWM has been successfully deployed on physical multi-robot tasks using two Unitree Go2-W robots, validating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.
