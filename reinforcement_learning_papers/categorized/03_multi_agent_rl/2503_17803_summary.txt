**TITLE:** A Roadmap Towards Improving Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Causal Discovery and Inference
**ARXIV_ID:** 2503.17803v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a causal augmentation approach to improve the efficacy, efficiency, and safety of MARL algorithms. The approach involves learning a minimal causal model of the environment dynamics and using it to modulate the action space of the agents. The causal model is learned using a constraint-based method, and the action space is filtered using a causal inference mechanism.
