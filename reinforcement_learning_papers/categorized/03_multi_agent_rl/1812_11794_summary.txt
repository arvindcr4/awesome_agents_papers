ARXIV_ID: 1812.11794v2
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper reviews the challenges and solutions of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in multi-agent systems (MAS). The authors discuss the non-stationarity problem, partial observability, and continuous action spaces in MAS, and present various DRL algorithms and techniques to address these challenges. They also survey the applications of DRL in MAS, including game playing, robotics, and smart grids.
