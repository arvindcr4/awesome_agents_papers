METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper proposes a novel approach to credit assignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning, called QLLM, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a training-free credit assignment function. The method involves a coder-evaluator framework, where two LLMs work together to produce a reliable and interpretable credit assignment function. The coder LLM generates candidate functions based on task-specific prompts, while the evaluator LLM selects the most promising one. The resulting function, called TFCAF, is used to assign credits to individual agents in a multi-agent system.

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* Proposes a novel approach to credit assignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning using LLMs
* Introduces a coder-evaluator framework for generating reliable and interpretable credit assignment functions
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of QLLM in various multi-agent environments, including cooperative navigation and football
* Shows that QLLM outperforms existing baselines in terms of average return and convergence speed
* Provides a detailed analysis of the method's performance and limitations, including its ability to handle high-dimensional state spaces and its compatibility with different LLMs.
