Abstract—Many cooperative multi-agent problems require
agents to learn individual tasks while contributing to the collective success of the group. This is a challenging task for current
state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement algorithms that are
designed to either maximize the global reward of the team or
the individual local rewards. The problem is exacerbated when
either of the rewards is sparse leading to unstable learning. To
address this problem, we present Decomposed Multi-Agent Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DE-MADDPG): a novel cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that simultaneously learns to maximize the global and local rewards. We
evaluate our solution on the challenging defensive escort team
problem and show that our solution achieves a significantly better
and more stable performance than the direct adaptation of the
MADDPG algorithm.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cooperative multi-agent problems are prevalent in realworld settings such as strategic conflict resolution [1], coordination between autonomous vehicles [2] and collaboration
of agents in defensive escort teams [3]. Such problems can
be modelled as dual-interest: each agent is simultaneously
working towards maximizing its own payoff (local reward)
as well as the collective success of the team (global reward).
For example, autonomous vehicles in double-lane merge conflicts must perform cooperative maneuvers without diverging
from their destination-bound nominal trajectories. Similarly,
in the case of a defensive escort team, each agent has
to maintain a specific distance from the payload to avoid
disrupting any social norms without sacrificing the security
of the payload. Despite the recent success of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) in multiplayer games like
Dota 2 [4], Quake III Capture-the-Flag [5] and Starcraft II [6]
or learning to use tools [7], learning multi-agent cooperation
while simultaneously maximizing local rewards is still an open
challenge. In this learning problem, to which we will refer
as “dual-reward MARL”, the agents are explicitly receiving
two reward signals: the global team reward and the agent’s
individual local reward.
This work had been supported in part by the National Science Foundation
under grant number IIS-1409823.

Current state-of-the-art MARL algorithms can be categorized in two types. For algorithms such as COMA [8] and
QMIX [9], the goal is to maximize the global reward for the
success of the group while algorithms such MADDPG [10]
and M3DDPG [11] focus on optimizing local rewards without
any explicit notion of coordination. As shown in [12] and
in our findings in Section V, a direct adaptation of these
algorithms to dual-reward problems often leads to poor performance and unstable learning. Generally, these adaptations
happen in the reward function space where the local and
the global reward signals are combined to form an entangled
multi-objective reward function [13]. This coupling of reward
functions leads to two problems. First, the entangled reward
function becomes unfactorizable during training, causing the
learning to oscillate between optimizing either the global or the
local reward leading to a sub-optimal and unstable solution.
This problem is exacerbated when either of the rewards is
sparse, thus, leading to a bias towards the other. The second
problem is that maximizing the entangled reward function does
not correspond to maximizing the objective function.
To address these issues, we present Decomposed MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DE-MADDPG):
a novel cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework built on top of deterministic policy gradients that simultaneously learns to maximize the global and the local rewards
without the need of creating an entangled multi-objective
reward function. The core idea behind DE-MADDPG is to
train two critics. The global critic, shared between all the
cooperating agents takes as input the observations and actions
of these agents and estimates the sum of the global expected
reward. The local critic receives as input only the observation
and action of the particular agent and estimates the sum of
local expected reward. The advantage of training two critics is
that the step of designing an entangled multi-objective reward
function can be skipped altogether.
To summarize, our contributions in this paper are the
following:
• We develop a dual-critic framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that learns to simultaneously maximize the decomposed global and local rewards.
• Taking advantage of the decomposition, we treat the
global critic as a single-agent critic. This allows us to

apply performance enhancement techniques such as Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) [14] and Twin Delayed
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3) [15] to tackle
the overestimation bias problem in Q-functions. This was
not previously feasible in the multi-agent RL setting.
• We evaluate our proposed solution on the defensive
escort team problem [3], [16] (see Figure 1) and show
that it achieves a significantly better and more stable
performance than the direct adaptation of the MADDPG
algorithm.
II. R ELATED WORK
Early theoretical work in MARL was limited to discrete
state and action spaces [17], [18], [19]. Recent work have
adopted techniques from single-agent deep RL to develop
general algorithms for high-dimensional continuous space
environments requiring complex agent interactions [1], [20],
[10].
Cooperative multi-agent learning is important since many
real-world problems can be formulated as distributed systems
with decentralized agents that must coordinate to achieve
shared objectives [21]. Similar to our work, [22] have shown
that agents whose rewards depend on all agents’ success
perform better than agents who optimize for their own success.
In the special case when all agents have a single goal and share
a global reward, COMA [8] uses a counterfactual baseline.
However, the centralized critic in these methods only focuses
on optimizing the collective success of the group. When
a global objective is the sum of agents’ individual objectives, value-decomposition methods optimize a centralized Qfunction while preserving scalable decentralized execution [9],
but do not address credit assignment. While MADDPG [10]
and M3DDPG [11] apply to agents with different reward functions, they do not specifically address the need for cooperation;
in fact, they do not distinguish the problems of cooperation
and competition, despite the fundamental difference.
To the best of our knowledge, dual-reward MARL was
not explicitly addressed in the existing literature. Among
the related problems, [23] explored the multi-goal problem
and analyzed its convergence in a special networked setting
restricted to fully-decentralized training. In contrast, we are
conducting centralized training with decentralized execution.
In contrast to multi-task MARL, which aims for generalization
among non-simultaneous tasks [24], and in contrast to hierarchical methods with top-level managers that sequentially select
subtasks [25], our decentralized agents must cooperate in
parallel to successfully achieve the global and their respective
local objectives.
III. BACKGROUND
A. Policy Gradients
Policy gradient methods have been shown to learn the
optimal policy in a variety of reinforcement learning tasks.
The main idea behind policy gradient methods is that instead
of parameterizing the Q-function to extract the policy, we
parameterize the policy using the parameters θ to maximize

the objective represented as J (θ) = E [Rt ] by taking a step
in the direction
∇J(θ) = E [∇θ log πθ (a|s) Qπ (s, a)]
Policy gradient methods are prone to the high variance problem. Several methods such as [26], [27] have been shown to
reduce the variability by introducing a critic, a Q-function
that tells about the goodness of a reward by working as a
baseline. [28] has shown that it is possible to extend the policy
gradient framework to deterministic policies i.e. πθ : S → A.
In particular we can write ∇J (θ) as


∇J(θ) = E ∇θ π (a|s) ∇a Qπ (s, a) |a=π(s)
A variation of this model, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients
(DDPG) [29] is an off-policy algorithm that approximates the
policy π and the critic Qπ with deep neural networks. DDPG
uses an experience replay buffer alongside a target network to
stabilize the training. Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradients (TD3) [15] improves on DDPG by addressing the
overestimation bias of the Q-function, similarly to Double Qlearning [30]. They find that approximation errors of the neural
network, combined with gradient descent make DDPG tend to
overestimate the Q-values, leading to a slower convergence.
TD3 addresses this by using two Q-networks Qψ1 , Qψ2 , along
with two target networks. The Q-functions are updated with
the target y = rt + γ min1,2 Qψi0 (s0t , a0t ), while updating the
policy with Qψ1 . Additionally, they introduce target policy
smoothing by adding noise in the determination of the next
action for the critic target a0t = µθπ0 (s0 ) + , with  being
clipped Gaussian noise  = clip(N (0, σ), −c, c), where c
is a tunable parameter. Additionally, they use delayed policy
updates and only update the policy π and target network
parameters once every d critic updates.
Multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients (MADDPG) [10] extends DDPG for the multi-agent setting where
each agent has it’s own policy. The gradient of each policy is
written as


∇J(θi ) = E ∇θi πi (ai |oi ) ∇ai Qπi (s, a1 , . . . , aN ) |ai =πi (oi )
where s = (o1 , . . . , oN ) and Qπi (s, a1 , . . . , aN ) is a centralized action-value function that takes the actions of all
the agents in addition to the state of the environment to
estimate the Q-value for agent i. Since every agent has its
own Q-function, the model allows the agents to have different
action space and reward functions. The primary insight behind
MADDPG is that knowing all the actions of other agents
makes the environment stationary, even though their policy
changes.
Very recently [31] proposed Multi-Agent TD3 (MATD3)
extending MADDPG by replacing the deterministic policy
gradients with twin delayed deterministic policy gradient to
tackle the overestimation bias problem.

algorithm that learns to simultaneously maximize the group’s
global reward and the agent’s local rewards. Our approach
uses a two critic approach to train policies and value functions
that are optimal to maximize the global and local rewards
respectively.
The main idea is to combine MADDPG (or MATD3) for
maximizing global rewards with a standard single agent DDPG
(or TD3). Intuitively, the goal is to move the policy in the
direction that maximizes both the global and the local critic.
The resulting learning paradigm is similar to the centralized training with decentralized execution during testing used
by [10]. In this setting, additional information is provided for
the agents during training that is not available during test time.
Concretely, we consider an environment with N agents
with policies π = {π1 , . . . , πN } parameterized by θ =
{θ1 , . . . , θN }. The multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient for agent i can written as


∇J(θi ) = E ∇θi πi (ai |oi ) ∇ai Qπi (s, a1 , . . . , aN ) |ai =πi (oi )
where s = (o1 , . . . , oN ) and Qπi (s, a1 , . . . , aN ) is a centralized action-value function parameterized by φi that takes
the actions of all the agents in addition to the state of the
environment to estimate the Q-value for agent i. We extend

Overestimation bias in Q-functions have been thoroughly studied in [15], [31]. This overestimation bias can be problemsome
in multi-agent settings especially in real time autonomous
systems. For example, in resolving the double lane merge
conflict in autonomous vehicles, the vehicles might consider
the current state to be near conflict resolution thus taking a
dangerous turns. To solve this problem [15] have proposed
a double critic approach to minimize the overestimation bias.
Motivated from the results in [15], we replace the Multi-Agent
Deterministic Policy Gradient of the global critic in Equation (1) with Twin Delayed Deterministic Policy Gradient.
Therefore our updated policy gradient becomes

V. E XPERIMENTS
A. Environments
We perform our experiments using the defensive escort
problem on four VIP protection environments [16], [3]. This is
a medium-size collaborative problem where a defensive escort
team of agents is learning to maintain an optimal formation

around the VIP (payload). The objective of the defenders is to
minimize the potential physical attacks as the VIP is moving in
a variety of different real world scenarios and are implemented
in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment [20]. An illustration
of the environments can be seen in Figure 1.

world situations and providing substantial variability, four
different scenarios were developed that differ in the number,

Random Landmark: In this fully stochastic scenario,
landmarks are placed randomly in the area. The starting
point and destination for the VIP are randomly selected
landmarks. The bystanders are performing random waypoint navigation: they choose a landmark at random,
move towards it and repeat this process till the end of
the episode.
• Shopping Mall: In this scenario, landmarks are placed at
the edge of the environment emulating shops on a street
or shopping mall. The bystanders are moving between
randomly chosen shops.
• Street: This scenario aims to model a crowded sidewalk.
The bystanders are moving in two different directions
towards waypoints that are outside the current area. However, due to their proximity to each other, the position of

where rglobal represents the reward that each agent receives
given the formation of the team around the VIP at time-step t,
therefore, represents the main objective of the team and rlocal
represents the reward that the agent receives for maintaining
a certain distance from the VIP and is defined as

where m is the minimum distance the agent has to maintain
from VIP and d is the safe distance. As per our understanding,
rtotal has two problems. The first problem is the stability

issue since the policy oscillates between optimizing the global
reward and the local reward. This stability problem exacerbates
when either of the rewards are sparse and the other reward is
dense. This phenomenon is also explained in Section V-C.
The second problem is the α hyper-parameter. The α hyperparameter assigns weight to both rewards. Given the various
difficulty settings of the simulations, security should be prioritized in some simulations as compared to the others. Moreover,
as reinforcement learning experiments take substantial amount
of time, finding an optimal α can be time consuming.
We solve this problem by having a dual critic architecture
where the task of the global centralized critic is to approximate
the cumulative global reward while each agent’s local critic approximates its own local reward. In this particular scenario, Qgψ
learns to approximate rglobal while Qπθi approximates rlocal .
The benefit of this decomposition is more stable learning and
exclusion of the α hyper-parameter.
B. Evaluations
To evaluate the efficacy of DE-MADDPG and its variants
we compare our results with baseline MADDPG and DDPG on
defensive escort team problem in the environments described
above. We trained the global critic with two different approaches. In the first approach, we updated the policy by using
the standard Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
mentioned in Equation (1) while in the second approach, we
updated the policy using the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient mentioned in Equation (2). Additionally, to
mitigate the global sparse reward problem, we replace the
standard replay buffer with prioritized experience replay buffer
(PER). We performed our experiments on 8 different seeds. We
used three layered neural networks for both the critic and actor
networks. For each environment, we trained each approach
for 20, 000 episodes except the Pie-in-the-Face environment
which was trained for 10, 000 episodes.
Figure 3 shows the learning curves of our experiments.
Figure 3a corresponds to the Random Landmark environment
and it can be seen that DE-MADDPG based approaches
outperforms the MADDPG and DDPG by a significant margin.
Similar observation can be seen for the other two environments i.e., Shopping Mall, and Street. Finally, for the last
environment Pie-in-the-Face, there is little difference between
the performance of the different approaches. A possible reason
for this is that this environment, focusing on a single attacking
bystander, makes the positioning choice less complex.
Though, fig. 3 shows the learning curves that visually
represents the performance of the different approaches, it does
not quantitatively explain the improvement in performance
across different approaches. To that end, we test our trained
policies across all environments on 8 different seeds. Table I
shows the average returns of the global reward over 1000
episodes. We notice that in complex environments such as
Shopping Mall and Random Landmarks, DE-MADDPG augmented with TD3 and PER were able to achieve 55% and 73%
better performance than baseline MADDPG. Similarly, on the

slightly less complex environments Street and Pie-in-the-Face,
the performance was about 61% and 100% better.

Figure 4 and Table II shows the learning curves and the
test results of the sum of the local rewards. Similar to the
global reward, it can be seen in Figure 4 and and Table II that
DE-MADDPG based approaches outperforms MADDPG and
DDPG results. One point to be noted here is that maintaining
a certain distance from a moving payload is fairly an easy
problem for standard reinforcement learning algorithms as the
reward is dense and the state space is relatively easy but adding
an additional objective such as global reward maximization not
only had catastrophic affect on the global reward maximization
but also negatively effected the learning of a trivial task.

A common pattern can be seen in Figure 3 and Figure 4
that DE-MADDPG based approaches not only achieve higher
global and local rewards, they achieve it significantly faster as
compared to MADDPG and DDPG. For example, in complex
environments such as Random Landmarks and Shopping Mall,
DE-MADDPG (TD3 + PER) reaches the maximum performance before 2500 episodes while the baseline MADDPG
reaches its best performance for Random Landmarks and
Shopping Mall environment at around 12, 000 episodes and
20, 000 episodes respectively.
C. Stability
One of the focal point of this study was to find a stable
solution that solves the dual-reward MARL problem. In this
section, we analyse the stability of DE-MADDPG based
solutions. Though, Figure 3 shows that DE-MADDPG when
augmented with TD3 outperforms MADDPG in maximizing
global reward, the average of results across all the seeds make
it difficult to analyze the stability. For that purpose, we chose
fixed single seed runs of all the solutions on the Shopping
Mall environment and plotted their learning curves. It can be
seen in Figure 5 that all DE-MADDPG based solutions are
stable in learning to maximize global reward as compared
to baseline MADDPG. This behavior is common across all
seeds and environments except Pie-in-the-Face as it is does
not provide any complexity.

D. Multi-Scenario Experiments
Multi-agent reinforcement learning is sensitive to distortions
and does not work well if the trained policies are deployed
on scenarios other than the scenario on which the policies
are trained on. This problem is generally referred as single-

In this section we evaluate the growth of parametric space
as the number of agents increases. Moreover, we empirically
evaluate the computational time for DE-MADDPG and compare it with MADDPG and DDPG. The main component of the
MADDPG that fuels its learning are the distributed centralized
Q-functions. As the number of the agents grow, the input
space of those Q-functions increase quadratically. Concretely,
assuming all the agents have identical observation and action
space, the number of trainable parameters can be represented
by O(n2 (odim + adim)). Where n is the number of agents,

odim and adim represents the dimensionality of observation
and action space respectively. Alternatively, DE-MADDPG
solves this scalability problem by having a shared global centralized Q-function whose parametric space increases linearly
and can be represented as O(n(odim+adim)). In Figure 8, we
show the growth of number of parameters of all the main Qnetworks of MADDPG, DE-MADDPG and its TD3 variant. It
can be seen that our solution takes significantly small number
of parameters as MADDPG and MAUPG. Note that the figure
only represents the number of trainable parameters in the main
Q-networks and does not include target or policy networks as
the growth of the policy network parameters are identical and
no gradient based learning happens in the target networks. All
these statements hold true for their UVFA variants.
We empirically verified the benefits of parametric reduction
by measuring the time taken to train the experiments. It can be
seen in Table V that DE-MADDPG based approaches always
train faster than baseline MADDPG. The complete details
about the network architecture can be seen in Section VI.
We do not provide time comparisons for DDPG and UVFA
variants as the experiments were run on multiple machines
with a variety of hardware thus making it difficult for a fair
comparison.

of both networks use linear activation function. Both networks
are initialized using Xavier normal initializers however, the
output layer of the target critics were initialized with uniform
random values between (-0.01 and 0.01) to enable one-step
look ahead learning of the critics after each training cycle.
To keep experiments as fair as possible, we initialized the
network parameters with same seed across all the experiments.
Complete hyperparameter details can be seen in Table VI. Note
that same configurations were used for multi-scenario learning
experiments.
VII. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we focused on the dual-reward MARL: a
collaborative setting where a group of learning agents have to
simultaneously learn to maximize the collective global reward
and individual local reward. To solve the problem, we proposed the Decomposed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DE-MADDPG) algorithm and applied it to the
problem of defensive escort team: how can agent learn a policy

to maintain an optimal formation around the VIP to protect
him/her from possible physical attack. We first demonstrated
that decomposing a multi-objective reward function leads to
higher and more stable performance. We compared our results
with the MADDPG algorithm and achieved at least 50% better
performance in terms of the collected reward. Additionally,
we showed that our solution is computationally efficient and
requires a significantly lower number of parameters while
achieving better performance than the baseline. Finally, we
showed that by replacing the standard critics with UVFAs,
our solution also outperforms MAUPG which is a baseline
algorithm for single-task multi-scenario learning in multiagent reinforcement learning.
