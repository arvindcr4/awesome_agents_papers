**TITLE:** Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Systems with Continuous Action Spaces
**ARXIV_ID:** 2108.03952v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 05_safe_constrained_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a method for safe deep reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems with continuous action spaces. The method extends the Safe DDPG approach to multi-agent settings and introduces soft constraints in the optimization objective to handle cases where multiple constraints are active.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a soft-constrained formulation of the safety layer to handle infeasibility problems in multi-agent systems
* Extends the Safe DDPG approach to multi-agent settings with continuous action spaces
* Empirically evaluates the performance of the proposed method in multi-agent particle environments with collisions and unsafe initialization
* Achieves a significant reduction in constraint violations during training and testing compared to unconstrained and hard-constrained MADDPG methods.
