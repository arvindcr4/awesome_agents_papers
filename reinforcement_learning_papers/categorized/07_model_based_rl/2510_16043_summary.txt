TITLE: The Probability of Vacuum Metastability and Artificial Vacuum Decay: Expert Survey Results
ARXIV_ID: 2510.16043v1
RESEARCH_METHOD: 07_model_based_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The study employed a survey-based approach to gather expert opinions on the probability of vacuum metastability and artificial vacuum decay. A total of 20 expert physicists were surveyed, and their responses were analyzed to provide insights into the likelihood of these events. The survey questions were designed to elicit probabilities and explanations for the respondents' answers, allowing for a qualitative analysis of the results.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
- The survey found that experts estimate a 45.6% chance that our vacuum is metastable, with a wide range of opinions from 0% to 95%.
- Assuming metastability, more than half of the experts thought that no technology could trigger vacuum decay, while a minority believed it would be feasible for a sufficiently advanced civilization.
- Respondents suggested that resolving these questions primarily depends on developing theories that go beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, particularly relating to uncertainty on whether the Standard Model remains valid at the energy scales relevant to vacuum decay.
- The survey highlights the need for further research and discussion to reach a consensus on vacuum decay and its potential implications for the longevity of the universe and the limits of advanced civilizations.
