Abstract Snippet:
Transformers as Decision Makers: Provable In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Pretraining  arXiv:2310.08566v2 [cs.LG] 26 May 2024  Licong Lin∗  Yu Bai†§  Song Mei‡§  May 28, 2024 Abstract Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In particular, it is...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Transformers as Decision Makers: Provable In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Pretraining  arXiv:2310.08566v2 [cs.LG] 26 May 2024  Licong Lin∗  Yu Bai†§  Song Mei‡§  May 28, 2024 Abstract Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction trajectories from unseen environments."
- "In particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data affects the learned algorithms."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 12_generalization_procgen because it explicitly discusses concepts such as generalization, procedural, procgen, matching the research direction's core themes.
