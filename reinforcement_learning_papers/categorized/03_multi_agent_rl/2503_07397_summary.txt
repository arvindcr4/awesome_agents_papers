**ARXIV_ID:** 2503.07397v1

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** Q-MARL is a decentralized learning architecture that supports large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios. It uses a graph-based approach to decompose the environment into smaller sub-graphs, each representing a local neighborhood. The model uses a message-passing neural network to capture nuanced influence across agents within a neighborhood.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Q-MARL formulates a general MARL scenario as a graph-based problem, where homogeneous agents' policies can be employed in a decentralized fashion.
* Q-MARL proposes a graph-based model based on a message-passing neural network mechanism, where all vertices and edges can interact with each other.
* Q-MARL implements a decentralized framework, where each agent acquires its own information and neighborhood information, forms a graph, and executes an action from the trained model without the existence of a central manager.
* Q-MARL demonstrates improved performance and generalization in various MARL scenarios, including Jungle, Battle, and Deception.
* Q-MARL shows significant reductions in training time and loss compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
