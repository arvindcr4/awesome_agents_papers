Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "arXiv:1806.06914v1 [cs.LG] 10 Jun 2018  Distributional Advantage Actor-Critic  Shangda Li Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213 shangdal@andrew.cmu.edu  Selina Bing Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213 zbing@andrew.cmu.edu  Steven Yang Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213 rujiay@andrew.cmu.edu  Abstract In traditional reinforcement learning, an agent maximizes the reward collected during its interaction with the environment by approximating the optimal policy through the estimation of value functions."
- "The optimal action is then chosen to be the action a with the largest value estimated by value function."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
