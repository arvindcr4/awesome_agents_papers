**PAPER:** Inter-Level Cooperation in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Inter-Level Cooperation in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1912.02368v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 04_hierarchical_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper introduces a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, called Cooperative Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CHER). CHER promotes cooperation between the high-level and low-level policies in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. The method modifies the objective function and gradients of the high-level policy to encourage cooperation with the low-level policy. This is achieved by propagating losses from the low-level policy to the high-level policy, allowing the high-level policy to learn more informative goal-assignment behaviors.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces a new approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, called Cooperative Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CHER)
* Proposes a method to promote cooperation between high-level and low-level policies in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of CHER in various continuous control tasks, including agent navigation and mixed-autonomy traffic control
* Shows that CHER can improve the transferability of learned policies to different tasks
* Provides a derivation of the gradient of the manager policy with respect to the worker policy in a two-level goal-conditioned hierarchy
