**PAPER:** Emergent Social Learning via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Emergent Social Learning via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2010.00581v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper investigates how independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a multi-agent environment can learn to use social learning to improve their performance. The authors propose a model-based auxiliary loss to enable agents to learn from the cues of other agents, and show that this approach can lead to improved generalization to novel environments.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a new approach to social learning in multi-agent RL, which enables agents to learn from the cues of other agents without explicit communication or shared goals.
* They show that this approach can lead to improved generalization to novel environments, and that agents can learn to adapt online to new environments with new experts.
* The authors also demonstrate that their approach can be used to learn complex behaviors that are difficult to discover through individual exploration, and that it can be used to improve performance in environments with high exploration costs.
