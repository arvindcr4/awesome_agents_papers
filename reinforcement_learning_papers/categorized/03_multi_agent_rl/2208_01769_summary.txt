TITLE: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Interaction
ARXIV_ID: 2208.01769v1
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The paper presents research on deep reinforcement learning for multi-agent interaction, focusing on scalable learning of coordinated agent policies and inter-agent communication. The authors develop novel algorithms for multi-agent deep RL, including Shared Experience Actor-Critic and Selective Parameter Sharing, and explore applications in ad hoc teamwork, autonomous driving, and secure authentication. The research group maintains open-source code repositories and discusses open problems in the literature, including generalization in RL, causal RL, and open challenges in ad hoc teamwork.
