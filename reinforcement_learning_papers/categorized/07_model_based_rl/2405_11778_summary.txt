* **TITLE**: Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning by Planning
* **ARXIV_ID**: 2405.11778v1
* **RESEARCH_METHOD**: 07_model_based_rl (Model-Based Reinforcement Learning)
* **METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: The paper proposes a model-based multi-agent algorithm called MAZero, which combines a centralized model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for policy search. MAZero is designed to improve sample efficiency in multi-agent environments and outperforms existing model-free and model-based methods in terms of sample and computational efficiency.
