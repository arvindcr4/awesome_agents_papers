* Title: MALib: A Parallel Framework for Population-based Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
* arXiv ID: 2106.07551v1
* Research Method: 03_multi_agent_rl

**Method Description**

MALib is a parallel framework designed for population-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (PB-MARL). It provides a centralized task dispatching model, an Actor-Evaluator-Learner programming architecture, and abstractions for MARL training paradigms. MALib aims to support high-parallelism training and implementation of PB-MARL algorithms.

**Key Contributions**

* Proposed a centralized task dispatching model for PB-MARL
* Introduced an Actor-Evaluator-Learner programming architecture for high-parallelism training
* Abstracted MARL training paradigms for code reuse and flexibility
* Implemented various MARL algorithms, including PSRO, MADDPG, and QMIX
* Demonstrated the performance of MALib on several multi-agent environments, including MA-Atari and StarCraft II.
