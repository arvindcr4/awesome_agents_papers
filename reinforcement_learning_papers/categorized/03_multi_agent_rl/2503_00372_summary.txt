**PAPER:** Nucleolus Credit Assignment for Effective Coalitions in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Nucleolus Credit Assignment for Effective Coalitions in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2503.00372v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** 
The proposed method uses a nucleolus-based credit assignment approach to enable the formation of multiple effective coalitions in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The nucleolus is a concept from cooperative game theory that provides a fair and stable distribution of rewards among agents. The method extends the traditional MARL framework by introducing a new entity-based, partially observable coalition Markov decision process (EC-POMDP) that supports coalition formation. The nucleolus-based credit assignment approach is used to assign credits to each agent based on their contribution to the coalition's performance.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
- Introduction of a nucleolus-based credit assignment approach for MARL
- Development of an entity-based, partially observable coalition Markov decision process (EC-POMDP) to support coalition formation
- Proposal of a nucleolus Q-value based on the Markov nucleolus to ensure optimal coalition structure and actions
- Introduction of a new nucleolus-based Bellman operator to converge to the optimal nucleolus Q-value
- Experimental evaluation of the proposed method on Predator-Prey and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance compared to baseline methods.
