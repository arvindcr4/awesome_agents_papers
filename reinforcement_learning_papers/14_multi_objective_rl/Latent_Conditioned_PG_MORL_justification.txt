Abstract Snippet:
Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction  Deepak Pathak 1 Pulkit Agrawal 1 Alexei A. Efros 1 Trevor Darrell 1  arXiv:1705.05363v1 [cs.LG] 15 May 2017  Abstract In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent’s ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-...
