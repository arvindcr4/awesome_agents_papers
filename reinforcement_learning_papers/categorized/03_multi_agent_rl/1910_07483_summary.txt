**PAPER:** MAVEN: Multi-Agent Variational Exploration
**TITLE:** MAVEN: Multi-Agent Variational Exploration
**ARXIV_ID:** 1910.07483v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper introduces a new multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Multi-Agent Variational Exploration (MAVEN). MAVEN combines value-based and policy-based methods to learn a hierarchical policy that conditions on a shared latent variable. This allows for committed exploration and improved performance in complex multi-agent tasks.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Introduction of the MAVEN algorithm, which combines value-based and policy-based methods for multi-agent reinforcement learning.
* Analysis of the effects of representational constraints on exploration in centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE).
* Experimental evaluation of MAVEN on various multi-agent tasks, including the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark (SMAC).
* Comparison of MAVEN with other state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, including QMIX and QTRAN.
* Demonstration of the importance of committed exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
