**PAPER:** Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
**TITLE:** Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The authors propose a parameter-efficient reinforcement learning from human feedback (PE-RLHF) method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning for reward modeling and reinforcement learning. The method aims to reduce the computational cost and complexity of traditional RLHF methods while maintaining comparable performance.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The authors propose a PE-RLHF method that uses LoRA fine-tuning for reward modeling and reinforcement learning.
* The method is evaluated on six diverse datasets and five distinct tasks, demonstrating comparable performance to traditional RLHF methods while reducing training time and memory footprint.
* The authors provide comprehensive ablation studies across LoRA ranks and model sizes for both reward modeling and reinforcement learning.
* The method is shown to achieve significant reductions in training time (up to 90% faster for reward models and 30% faster for RL) and memory footprint (up to 50% reduction for reward models and 27% for RL).
