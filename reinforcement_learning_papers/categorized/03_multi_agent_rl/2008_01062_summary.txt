**TITLE:** QPLEX: Duplex Dueling Multi-Agent Q-Learning

**ARXIV_ID:** 2008.01062v3

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** QPLEX is a novel multi-agent Q-learning framework that allows centralized end-to-end training and learns to factorize a joint action-value function to enable decentralized execution. QPLEX takes advantage of a duplex dueling architecture that efficiently encodes the IGM consistency constraint on joint and individual greedy action selections. Theoretical analysis shows that QPLEX achieves a complete IGM function class. Empirical results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both online and offline data collection settings.
