**TITLE:** PettingZoo: A Standard API for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2009.14471v7
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** PettingZoo is a library of diverse sets of multi-agent environments with a universal, elegant Python API. It was developed with the goal of accelerating research in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by making work more interchangeable, accessible, and reproducible. The library introduces a new formal model of games, Agent Environment Cycle (AEC) games, which serves as the basis of the PettingZoo API.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces the PettingZoo library and API for multi-agent reinforcement learning
* Develops the Agent Environment Cycle (AEC) games model as a basis for the PettingZoo API
* Provides a universal API for multi-agent environments, supporting various types of games and environments
* Includes 63 default environments, including Atari games, Butterfly environments, and classic board and card games
* Allows for easy creation of new environments and modification of existing ones
* Supports various learning libraries, including RLlib, Stable Baselines, and Tianshou
