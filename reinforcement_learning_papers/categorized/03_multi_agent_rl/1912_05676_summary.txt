**TITLE:** Biases for Emergent Communication in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1912.05676v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes two new shaping losses to encourage the emergence of communication in decentralized learning: one for positive signaling and one for positive listening. These losses are designed to ease the learning problem for the other agent, increasing the consistency with which agents learn useful communication protocols.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of two new shaping losses for emergent communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning
* Demonstration of the effectiveness of these losses in a simple environment and a temporally extended environment
* Analysis of the resulting communication protocols and their impact on agent behavior
* Discussion of the potential applications and limitations of these methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
