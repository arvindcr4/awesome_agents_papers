**TITLE:** A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Coordination Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles at Merging Roadways
**ARXIV_ID:** 2109.11672v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a decentralized, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for coordinating connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at merging roadways. The framework uses a centralized critic and decentralized actors to learn policies that ensure rear-end and lateral safety, while also encouraging high-speed travel. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through several simulations, showing that the learned policies can improve traffic throughput and safety.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* A decentralized, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for coordinating CAVs at merging roadways
* A centralized critic and decentralized actors architecture to learn policies that ensure rear-end and lateral safety
* A reward function that encourages high-speed travel while prioritizing safety
* Simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in improving traffic throughput and safety
* The ability to transfer learned policies to any number of vehicles, making the framework scalable and applicable to real-world scenarios.
