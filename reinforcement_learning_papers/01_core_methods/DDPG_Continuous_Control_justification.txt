Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Hunt∗, Alexander Pritzel, Nicolas Heess, Tom Erez, Yuval Tassa, David Silver & Daan Wierstra Google Deepmind London, UK {countzero, jjhunt, apritzel, heess, etom, tassa, davidsilver, wierstra} @ google.com  A BSTRACT We adapt the ideas underlying the success of Deep Q-Learning to the continuous action domain."
- "We present an actor-critic, model-free algorithm based on the deterministic policy gradient that can operate over continuous action spaces."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
