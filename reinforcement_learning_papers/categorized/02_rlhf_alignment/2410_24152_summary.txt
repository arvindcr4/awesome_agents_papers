**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel approach called Language-Driven Policy Distillation (LDPD) to enhance the learning capabilities of cooperative agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). LDPD leverages the reasoning efficiency of MARL-based agents alongside the extensive world knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a teacher agent powered by LLM and multiple student agents modeled with MARL, enabling effective knowledge transfer and collaborative learning.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a language-driven policy distillation framework to facilitate the learning and exploration process of multi-agent systems with distilled knowledge from LLM.
* They design a teacher-student policy distillation framework to guide MARL exploration, where the teacher agent trains smaller student agents to achieve cooperative decision-making through its own decision-making demonstrations.
* The authors demonstrate that the students can rapidly improve their capabilities with minimal guidance from the teacher and eventually surpass the teacher's performance.
* They show that their approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of learning efficiency and overall performance.
* The authors also evaluate the safety performance of their method and compare it with other baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in ensuring safe and efficient cooperative driving.
