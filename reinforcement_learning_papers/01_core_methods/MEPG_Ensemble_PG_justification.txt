E-mail(s): takuya.kanazawa.cz@hitachi.com; Abstract Sequential decision making in the real world often requires finding a good balance of conflicting objectives. In general, there exist a plethora of Pareto-optimal policies that embody different patterns of compromises between objectives, and it is technically challenging to obtain them exhau...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "arXiv:2303.08909v2 [cs.LG] 5 Oct 2024  Latent-Conditioned Policy Gradient for Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning Takuya Kanazawa and Chetan Gupta Industrial AI Lab, Hitachi America, Ltd."
- "In this work, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm that trains a single neural network via policy gradient to approximately obtain the entire Pareto set in a single run of training, without relying on linear scalarization of objectives."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
