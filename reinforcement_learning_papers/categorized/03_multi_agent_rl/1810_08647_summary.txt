TITLE: Social Influence as Intrinsic Motivation for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning

ARXIV_ID: 1810.08647v4

RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl

METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The paper proposes a unified mechanism for achieving coordination and communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by rewarding agents for having causal influence over other agents' actions. Causal influence is assessed using counterfactual reasoning. 

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* The paper introduces a novel intrinsic motivation for MARL, which rewards agents for having causal influence over other agents' actions.
* The authors demonstrate that this approach can lead to emergent communication and coordination in challenging social dilemma environments.
* The influence reward is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the mutual information between agents' actions.
* The authors also propose a model of other agents (MOA) to achieve independent training, where each agent learns to predict the actions of other agents.
* The approach is evaluated in three experiments, including a basic influence experiment, a communication experiment, and a MOA experiment, with promising results.
