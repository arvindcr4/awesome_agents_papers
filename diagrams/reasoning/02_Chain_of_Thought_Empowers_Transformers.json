    "prompt": "Create a flowchart diagram comparing serial vs parallel reasoning in transformers.\n\nInclude these key elements:\n- Parallel reasoning path: Multiple computations happening simultaneously\n- Serial reasoning path: Sequential step-by-step processing with CoT\n- Performance comparison: Show accuracy and complexity trade-offs\n- Transformer architecture: Attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks\n- Decision point: When to use serial vs parallel reasoning\n\nUse a side-by-side comparison layout. Green for serial reasoning, blue for parallel. Show clear performance metrics."
