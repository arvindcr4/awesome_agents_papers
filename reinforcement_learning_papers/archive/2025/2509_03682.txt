Abstract— Recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) have demonstrated its application potential in
modern games. Beginning with foundational work and
progressing to landmark achievements such as AlphaStar in
StarCraft II and OpenAI Five in Dota 2, MARL has proven capable
of achieving superhuman performance across diverse game
environments through techniques like self-play, supervised
learning, and deep reinforcement learning. With its growing
impact, a comprehensive review has become increasingly
important in this field. This paper aims to provide a thorough
examination of MARL's application from turn-based two-agent
games to real-time multi-agent video games including popular
genres such as Sports games, First-Person Shooter (FPS) games,
Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and Multiplayer Online Battle
Arena (MOBA) games. We further analyze critical challenges
posed by MARL in video games, including nonstationary, partial
observability, sparse rewards, team coordination, and scalability,
and highlight successful implementations in games like Rocket
League, Minecraft, Quake III Arena, StarCraft II, Dota 2, Honor of
Kings, etc. This paper offers insights into MARL in video game AI
systems, proposes a novel method to estimate game complexity,
and suggests future research directions to advance MARL and its
applications in game development, inspiring further innovation in
this rapidly evolving field.

I. INTRODUCTION

A

S of July 2023, more than 212.6 million people in the
U.S. play video games regularly, accounting for
approximately two-thirds of its entire population [1].
This significant engagement extends beyond the U.S., with an
even more pronounced trend globally, where the number
explodes to 3.22 billion [2].
Over the past several decades, video games have undergone
a fundamental transformation from primarily single-player or
turn-based titles to real-time, multiplayer formats. Today’s
most popular genres include MOBA, RTS, and FPS, all of
which are designed around team-based, competitive, or
cooperative multiplayer gameplay. As shown in Fig. 1, 88% of
players now report having played games online, indicating a
dominant trend toward networked, interaction-rich gameplay
environments. However, due to limitations such as player

dropout, matchmaking delays, game trainings, or single-player
modes in multiplayer-centric games, artificial intelligence (AI)controlled agents are frequently introduced to fill the roles of
human participants. This growing reliance on artificial
teammates and opponents has accelerated the demand for
robust multi-agent AI systems capable of modeling
coordination, adversarial behavior, and adaptation to human
strategies. Furthermore, genres such as strategy and social
simulation games offer ideal testbeds for MARL, as they
naturally involve complex, persistent interactions among
multiple autonomous agents.
For more than half a century, AI has been a critical part of
video games ever since their first application in the 1940s [4].
Early games like Space Invaders and Pac-Man in the 1970s and
1980s featured basic game AI systems to manage non-player
character (NPC) behaviors that provided predictable yet
engaging challenges for players. These fundamental AI systems
paved the way for more complex and smarter behaviors seen in
modern games. Today, in titles such as StarCraft, Age of
Empires, Sid Meier's Civilization, Call of Duty, Counter-Strike,
Grand Theft Auto, League of Legends, Dota 2, and many others,
AI technologies have evolved to address a large number of
challenges with intelligent and efficient planning and decisionmaking that enhance gaming experience and strategic depth. As
game environments have evolved from simple 2D planes 3D
worlds, the complexity and realism of these environments have
increased exponentially. This evolution has turned video games

2
ToG-2024-0292.R1
into a field of study that not only improves AI interactions in
those games, but also offers a valuable platform for applying
different AI techniques in real-world.
Modern games implement AI as a set of algorithms or
systems to manage numerous decisions and planning tasks
required in games, such as pathfinding, resource management,
combats, player or NPC behaviors, and player interactions.
Established techniques, such as finite state machines and
behavior trees [5] are frequently used to drive AI in games.
However, as games have become increasingly realistic, players
have begun to desire more intelligent and more realistic NPCs,
whether as cooperative companions, teammates, or competitive
opponents. Furthermore, these existing techniques like finite
state machines and behavior trees face limitations in handling
the dynamically changing and unpredictable environments
found in modern games, which can lead to repetitive behaviors
or game bugs. To address these challenges and meet the
increasing player demands for adaptive AI, researchers and
game developers have begun to explore other technical options
such as reinforcement learning (RL) [6].
RL is an interdisciplinary area of machine learning where an
agent learns optimal actions by interacting with an environment
to maximize cumulative rewards, guided by a policy and value
function. It can be relatively straightforward to implement in
new domains given a defined environment, set of actions, and
reward structure [7]. Video games naturally provide these
elements, making them ideal for RL applications. For instance,
RL has been used for intelligent unit micro-management in
StarCraft [8] and dynamical difficulty adjustment to maintain
game flow in turn-based battle video games [9]. While RL is
less suitable for large-scale strategic decision-making due to the
space complexity, delayed rewards and other challenges, its
effectiveness in smaller tactical scenarios shows promise for
enhancing game AI [10].
When game environments become more complex, the
knowledge space becomes too large for RL to store all stateaction pairs. To solve this, researchers started to use neural
networks to approximate state spaces or value/policy functions,
a technique known as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A
seminal work introduced the Deep Q-Network (DQN), which
the agent learns directly from raw pixel data and achieves
human-level performance in playing Atari games [11]. Later,
DRL was applied to play FPS games and achieved human-level
control [12], demonstrating its capability for real-time decisionmaking and navigation in 3D partially observable
environments. Furthermore, DRL has also been used for
navigation and pathfinding problems in AAA games [13],
which outperformed traditional algorithms like A* [14].
Moreover, MuZero [15], an algorithm that integrates modelbased planning with model-free learning, has demonstrated
superhuman performance across various games, including
Atari, Go, Chess, and Shogi. More recent applications of DRL
include the study on Gran Turismo Sport (GTS) [16], a racing
simulation game with realistic physics and competitive driving
mechanics. It applied a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm to
achieve superhuman performance in high-speed autonomous
driving tasks [17]. Additionally, in 2023, researchers and
developers from Electronic Arts integrated DRL into their
automated testing pipeline for AAA titles such as Battlefield

2042 and Dead Space [18].
While DRL has demonstrated significant success in video
games, existing applications primarily focus on single-agent
scenarios. In contrast, most modern video games involve
multiple agents interacting cooperatively or competitively.
Consequently, researchers and developers have turned to utilize
MARL to develop AI systems that can effectively manage and
optimize the interactions between multiple agents in games. In
recent years, MARL has made significant progress. Early work
on TD-Gammon in 1995 [19], demonstrated the potential of RL
in a two-agent scenario. In this work, the AI agent learned to
play Backgammon through self-play technique. Later on, the
development of AlphaGo [20] in 2016 is another major
milestone. AlphaGo applied supervised learning from human
expert games and RL from self-play to master the game of Go,
and eventually outperformed the world champion.
Subsequently, AlphaGo Zero [21] in 2017 learned solely
through self-play using RL without supervised learning. In the
same year, AlphaZero [22] went to public, applied what it
learned from Go to other board games such as Chess and Shogi.
This demonstrated that a single algorithm (or model) could
achieve superhuman performance across multiple games purely
through self-play. Further breakthroughs were achieved with
AlphaStar [23] in 2019, a significant advancement in MARL by
mastering the well-known RTS game StarCraft II. AlphaStar
trained using a combination of supervised learning from human
games, DRL through self-play, and a novel League Training
mythology, achieving a grandmaster level in StarCraft II. In the
same time, OpenAI Five [24] showed their work of applying
MARL to one of the most played MOBA game Dota 2. Unlike
earlier work with two agents, OpenAI Five successfully trained
multiple AI agents to play in a 5 vs. 5 setting and went on to
defeat the world champion team OG at The International 2018.
Given the increasing number of multi-agent systems in modern
games and the progress in MARL along with its recent
applications, focused reviews on this topic have become
increasingly important. Existing reviews provide extensive
insights into the theories, algorithms, and challenges of MARL
[25]–[28]. Additionally, recent advances in deep learning
across various video game genres have been reviewed [29],
with specific discussions on DRL in video games [30], and the
prospects of RL in the gaming industry [31]. While these
surveys primarily emphasize single-agent scenarios, we aim to
provide a comprehensive review of MARL in video games,
highlighting challenges, recent advancements, applications, and
future directions.
This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of
MARL applications and research in video games. We will
discuss implementation challenges such as partially observable
and nonstationary environments, delayed and sparse rewards,
team incentive mechanisms, communication and coordination,
credit assignment and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a
novel method to estimate game complexity using five key
dimensions: Observability, State Space, Action Space, Reward
Sparsity, and Multi-Agent Scale. We will examine notable
studies and successful implementations, starting with two-agent
games such as Backgammon, Go and Blade & Soul. We will
then extend our review to multi-agent games involving more
than two agents from simple to more complex games

3
ToG-2024-0292.R1
categorized by their genres, which includes the most popular
one: Competitive and Sports games such as 3v3 Snake, Google
Research Football, Ubisoft’s Roller Champions, and Rocket
League; FPS games including Doom and ViZDoom, Minecraft,
and Quake III Arena: Capture the Flag; RTS and MOBA, with
games like StarCraft II, Dota 2, and Honor of Kings. We will
discuss challenges from both the game development and
technical perspectives and propose new directions for future
research. Through this review, we hope to inspire further
research and innovation in game AI, and ultimately advancing
the capabilities of both MARL and game AI systems.

The goal is to learn the Q-function, which predicts the total
expected reward for taking action 𝑎 in state 𝑠 and following the
optimal policy thereafter. The Q-values are updated iteratively
using the Bellman equation:

II. BACKGROUND

𝐽(𝜃) = 𝔼𝜋𝜃 [∑ 𝛾 𝑡 𝑟𝑡 ]

𝑄(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) ← 𝑄(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) + 𝛼 [𝑟𝑡+1 + 𝛾 ∙ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑄(𝑠𝑡+1 , 𝑎) − 𝑄(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 )]
𝑎

(2)

where α is the learning rate. On the other hand, policy gradient
[33] methods take a policy-based approach by directly learning
the policy 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎|𝑠) without needing to compute value function.
The policy is parameterized by 𝜃 , and the objective is to
maximize the expected cumulative reward 𝐽(𝜃):
∞

A. Terminology
To establish a consistent conceptual foundation for this
review, we define key terms related to MARL in the context of
video games.
 An agent is defined as “a computer system that is situated
in some environment and capable of autonomous action in
order to meet its design objectives” [34]. Operationally,
within RL, an agent is characterized explicitly by its
observations (sensory inputs), state (information about the
environment), actions (outputs via actuators), and rewards
(feedback) [14], [34].
 A multi-agent system is a system that consists of a number
of distributed agents, which communicate and interact with
one another, typically by exchanging messages through
some computer or network infrastructure [34].
 Non-player characters (NPCs) are autonomous character
entities in video games that are not controlled by the player.
Traditional NPCs often rely on scripted, rule-based
systems such as finite state machines or behavior trees [35].
This review focuses explicitly on learning-based NPCs
implemented as RL agents, rather than depending on predefined
rules or logic scripts.
B. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
In typical or single-agent RL, the environment is stated in the
form of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is a
mathematical model defined by a tuple of five elements
(𝑆, 𝐴, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝛾). At each time-step, the agent observes the current
state 𝑠𝑡 , selects an action 𝑎𝑡 , receives a reward 𝑟𝑡+1 , and
transitions to the next state 𝑠𝑡+1 based on the transition
probability 𝑃(𝑠𝑡+1 |𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ). The agent’s goal is to learn a policy
𝜋(𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 ), which maps states to actions, in order to maximize the
cumulative reward, or return, 𝑅𝑡 , defined as:
∞

𝑅𝑡 = ∑ 𝛾 𝑖 𝑟𝑡+𝑖

(1)

𝑖=0

where 𝛾 is the discount factor in [0, 1] that determines how
much future rewards are weighted compared to immediate
rewards [6].
One of the fundamental algorithms in RL is Q-Learning
[32], which an agent learns the optimal policy by estimating the
value of state-action pairs, represented by a function 𝑄(𝑠, 𝑎).

(3)

𝑡=0

where 𝛾 is the discount factor that controls the importance of
future rewards.
C. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
DRL is a combination of RL and deep learning, where neural
networks are used to approximate policies or value functions.
One widely-used architecture is the Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) [11], where the agent learns from visual inputs
such as images or pixel data. Moreover, in environments with
sequential data, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their
variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [36], [37]
networks, are often used.
Building on Q-Learning in RL, Deep Q-Leaning or DQN
[11] extends the algorithm by using a deep neural network to
approximate the Q-function, so it can scale to high-dimensional
state spaces. Instead of maintaining a Q-table for each stateaction pair, DQN typically uses a CNN to estimate the Q-values
for different actions based on raw pixel input. To stabilize
learning, DQN incorporates experience replay, which stores
and reuses past experiences to break correlations between
consecutive samples, and target networks, which help reduce
oscillations by keeping a separate, slowly-updating network for
generating target values [38].
Moreover, the Actor-Critic [39] architecture extends policy
gradient methods by combining the benefits of policy-based
and value-based approaches. In this framework, the actor learns
the policy 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎|𝑠), mapping states to actions, while the critic
estimates the value function 𝑉(𝑠), providing feedback to the
actor to improve the policy. This approach reduces the high
variance typically present in policy gradient methods by
leveraging value-based learning to guide policy updates. The
purpose of the actor is to maximize the expected cumulative
reward, but instead of using raw returns, it utilizes feedback
from the critic through the advantage function:
𝛻𝜃 𝐽(𝜃) = 𝔼𝑡 [𝛻𝜃 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 ) ⋅ 𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 )]

(4)

where 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎𝑡 |𝑠𝑡 ) is the policy parameterized by 𝜃 , mapping
states to actions with the advantage function defined as:
𝐴(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) = 𝑄(𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 ) − 𝑉(𝑠𝑡 )

(5)

which measures how much better the action 𝑎𝑡 is compared to
value function 𝑉(𝑠) and minimizes the temporal difference
error to improve its estimation over time:

4

Fig. 2. This diagram shows the typical flow of MARL in video games. Agents receive observations, process them through different neural
networks, and output actions that lead to the next state in the game environment.
𝛿𝑡 = 𝑟𝑡+1 + 𝛾𝑉(𝑠𝑡 + 1) − 𝑉(𝑠𝑡 ).

(6)

Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [40] extends
the actor-critic framework to continuous action spaces using a
deterministic policy:
𝑎 = 𝜇𝜃 (𝑠)

(7)

Unlike stochastic policy gradient methods, DDPG
deterministically selects the best action for a given state. It uses
off-policy learning to maintain sample efficiency, where the
agent stores experiences in a replay buffer and learns from
them. The critic minimizes the Bellman error to stabilize value
estimation:
𝑦 = 𝑟 + 𝛾𝑄′ [𝑠 ′ , 𝜇 ′ (𝑠 ′ )]
(8)
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [41] improves on
traditional policy gradient methods by ensuring stable and
reliable policy updates. It introduces a clipped surrogate
objective to prevent large policy updates during each iteration,
balancing exploration and exploitation. This method is widely
used in both discrete and continuous action spaces due to its
stability and efficiency, with its clipped surrogate objective
function defined as:
𝐿𝐶𝐿𝐼𝑃 (𝜃) = 𝐸𝑡 [𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑟𝑡 (𝜃)𝐴𝑡 , 𝑐𝑙𝑖𝑝(𝑟𝑡 (𝜃), 1 − 𝜖, 1 + 𝜖)𝐴𝑡 )]
(9)
and the final PPO objective function as:
𝐿𝑃𝑃𝑂 = 𝐿𝐶𝐿𝐼𝑃 − 𝑐1 𝐿𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 + 𝑐2 𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑦

(10)

D. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
MARL builds on RL and DRL by extending the framework
of MDP to environments involving multiple agents [42]. In
MARL, agents interact with both the environment and each
other, each following its own policy, as shown in Fig. 2.
Formally, MARL is modeled as a Markov Game (also known
as a Stochastic Game) [43], defined by the tuple:
𝑁
𝑇 = (𝑆, {𝐴𝑖 }𝑁
𝑖=1 , 𝑃, {𝑅𝑖 }𝑖=1 , 𝛾)

(11)

where 𝑆 is the state space shared by all agents. 𝐴𝑖 is the action
space of agent 𝑖, 𝑃(𝑠 ′ |𝑠, 𝑎1 , . . . , 𝑎𝑁 ) is the transition probability
function, which describes how the state evolves given the joint
actions of all agents. 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎1 , . . . , 𝑎𝑁 ) is the reward function for
agent 𝑖 which may depend on the joint actions and the state. 𝛾 is
the discount factor that balances immediate and future rewards.

The goal of each agent is to learn a policy 𝜋𝜃 (𝑎|𝑠) that
maximizes its cumulative discounted reward:
∞

𝐽𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 ) = 𝔼 [∑ 𝛾 𝑡 𝑅𝑖 (𝑠𝑡 , 𝑎𝑡 )|𝜋1 , … , 𝜋𝑁 ]

(12)

𝑡=0

Depending on the task or goal they address, there are three
types of multi-agent interactions [43], [44]:
1) Competitive
These interactions are typically modeled as Zero-Sum
Markov Games, where the sum of all agents' rewards is
zero, implying that one agent’s gain is another’s loss.
2) Cooperative
In cooperative settings, agents share a common reward
function 𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎1 , . . . , 𝑎𝑁 ), aligning their objectives. This
setup is referred to as a multi-agent MDP and emphasizes
coordination for team-wise optimal outcomes.
3) Mixed
It is also referred as general-sum games. These settings
combine competitive and cooperative elements, where
agents may cooperate temporarily while pursuing their
individual objectives.
Self-play is a widely adopted training method in MARL,
particularly in competitive settings where agents learn by
playing against various versions of themselves. The method
allows agents to iteratively improve their performance without
the need for external opponents or pre-collected data. This
approach was notably successful in TD-Gammon [19]. Later,
AlphaGo [20] and AlphaZero [21] demonstrated the power of
self-play combined with DRL and Monte Carlo Tree Search to
master complex board games like Go, chess, and shogi. More
recently, self-play has been widely applied in various video
games such as StarCraft II [23] and Dota 2 [24] as a technique
to improve agent performance and training efficiency.
Another fundamental aspect of MARL is the choice of
training and execution paradigm. The three main paradigms are:
1) Centralized Training, Centralized Execution (CTCE):
All agents are trained and executed using shared global
information. This setup allows tight coordination but is
rarely practical for real-time systems due to scalability
and communication constraints.

5
ToG-2024-0292.R1
2) Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution
(CTDE): Agents are trained with access to global state or
other agents’ information, but at execution time, they
operate using only local observations. This paradigm
maintains a balance between coordination and
deployability and is widely used in practice.
3) Decentralized Training, Decentralized Execution
(DTDE): Each agent is trained and executed using only
its own observations and experiences. This setup is highly
scalable and realistic but can make coordination
significantly more difficult.
Across the reviewed games, the CTDE paradigm dominates
as the preferred training methodology. This reflects a common
design requirement that agents are trained with access to
centralized or shared state information to enable coordinated
policy learning. Also, decentralized execution complies with
real-time performance constraints. CTDE is particularly
effective in environments where agents need to cooperate
while still operating independently during gameplay. A few
exceptions adopt DTDE, such as ViZDoom’s Deathmatch,
which benefits from fully independent training due to its
simple, fully competitive setup. In highly flexible
environments like Minecraft, both CTDE and DTDE appear
depending on the scenario and mini game. In contrast, CTCE
is typically impractical for real-time video games, where
latency, scalability, and individual agent autonomy are
essential.
III. METHODOLOGY
This section outlines the methodology used to collect,
screen, and include the literature and work analyzed in this
review. Our objective was to construct a representative and
relevant corpus of works on MARL in video games. The final
corpus comprises 84 reports, separated into 40 core studies used
for synthesis and analysis, and 44 supplementary works
included to support background, theoretical framing, and
methodological context.
A. Scope and Structure
This review was designed to systematically identify,
organize, and analyze research on the application of MARL in
video game environments. The scope of our review is limited
to works in which MARL techniques are implemented and
evaluated in either competitive or cooperative multi-agent
video game settings. We include both two-agent and multiagent environments but exclude works that focus solely on
single-agent systems or other non-video-game environments.
The core synthesis is based on a curated set of 40 primary
studies, identified through expert knowledge, professional
search databases and citation chaining. To support technical
framing and historical context, an additional 44 documents are
included for background.
B. Data Sources and Search Strategy
The identification of relevant literature was guided first by
professional experience and domain familiarity accumulated
through ongoing research and development in MARL.

We then performed a structured search across major
academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital
Library, SpringerLink, Elsevier ScienceDirect, Wiley Online
Library, and arXiv, to collect high-quality studies. These
platforms were selected for their relevance to both AI and game
technology domains. Search terms included combinations of
"multi-agent", "reinforcement learning", and "video games",
tailored to each platform’s query syntax. This search phase
emphasized peer-reviewed journal articles, conference
proceedings, and preprints from reputable institutions.
To ensure comprehensive coverage beyond canonical
databases, we also conducted a supplementary search using
Google Scholar, which indexes broader sources such as
industry research and non-indexed preprints. The query used
was: “multi-agent”, “reinforcement learning”, and “video
game”. Google Scholar returned over 17,000 results, with only
the first 1,000 accessible. From these, the top 500 entries (25
pages) sorted by relevance were manually screened.
Finally, we applied forward and backward citation chaining
(snowballing) on key papers identified during earlier phases.
This step allowed us to capture important studies that may have
used non-standard terminology or were not ranked highly by
search algorithms.
C. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
To ensure consistency and relevance in the reviewed corpus,
we applied tailored inclusion and exclusion criteria depending
on the intended role of each report within the structure of the
review.
1) Inclusion Criteria - Reports were included in the core
corpus if they met all of the following criteria:
 They present a method involving MARL and applied
MARL to one or more video game environments,
including both real-time and turn-based games,
commercially or academically.
 They provided implementation details, such as model
architecture, training algorithm, reward structure, or
experimental results.
 These studies align with the definitions established in
Section II.A.
2) Exclusion Criteria - Reports were excluded if they met
any of the following criteria:
 Focused solely on single-agent RL or no RL.
 Employed abstract simulations or robotics tasks not
involving a recognizable game environment.
 Were tutorial, visionary, or purely theoretical in nature
without implementation or evaluation.
3) Additional Source Filtering – All Reports retrieved were
subject to the same criteria. For preprints, inclusion was
limited to reports that:
 Reported substantial original empirical results and
provided full methodological transparency.
 Were affiliated with reputable research institutions or
accepted by peer-reviewed workshops.
4) Background and Supporting Documents - A separate
set of reports was manually selected to provide
foundational context and theoretical grounding. These
include works introducing core RL algorithms, general

6
ToG-2024-0292.R1
MARL theory, and relevant surveys or industry
references. These reports were not selected through the
systematic search process and are not included in the
comparative synthesis, but are cited as needed.
D. Discussion of Strengths, Weaknesses, and Biases
This review uses a multi-stage and reproducible
methodology based on professional expertise, structured
database searches, and clear inclusion criteria. However,
citation chaining can bias selection toward more visible or
recent studies. Manual filtering also introduces subjectivity. We
mitigate these limitations by transparently documenting sources
and selection criteria.
IV. MARL CHALLENGES IN GAMES
A. Nonstationary and Partially Observable Environments
Modern game environments are inherently nonstationary
due to the presence of multiple agents interacting within the
same environment. This violates the stationary assumption of
traditional MDPs, where transition probability and reward
functions are expected to remain stationary. Moreover, video
game environments often only partially observable because they
typically have large maps that cannot be fully captured within a
single game camera view. In addition, many games also have
mechanics like "fog of war" to add strategic depth, where areas
and opposing units on the map remain unobservable unless
nearby ally units provide vision [45]. This partial observability
significantly complicates the learning process, requiring
Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs) [37], [46].
Consequently, many popular algorithms, such as independent
DQN, become impractical without substantial modifications.
Because of these elements, designing such MARL system in
StarCraft II is extremely challenging, due to uncertainty and
incomplete information [26].
B. Delayed and Sparse Rewards
In video games, the issue of delayed and sparse rewards is
significant due to the real-time nature and length of gameplay.
In general, video games run at 16-60 frames per second, and one
game could last from minutes to hours depending on the game.
For example, a game of Dota 2 lasts approximately 45 minutes
and runs at 30 frames per second [24]. The OpenAI Five agent
selects an action every fourth frame, summing up to roughly
20,000 steps per episode, compared to only 150 steps in a game
of Go. Additionally, in StarCraft II, professional players can
perform as many as 500 actions per minute (APM) [45], with
matches usually lasting around 15 minutes. These long game
durations plus high action frequencies can cause agents to
receive infrequent feedback from their actions.
C. Designing Team Incentive Mechanisms
In multiplayer video games, competitive settings typically
involve team-wise zero-sum Markov games, such as destroying
opponents' bases in Dota 2, StarCraft II, or Honor of Kings.
Cooperative settings can include solving team puzzles, as in
Minecraft, or collaborative play in online games like World of

Warcraft [47]. In both scenarios, teamwork weighs much more
than individual abilities in order to achieve objectives. To
encourage teamwork, challenges arise when designing
incentive mechanisms that align individual agent incentives
with overall team objectives. These mechanisms must prevent
agents from pursuing actions that benefit themselves at the
expense of the team’s success, but instead encourage them to
work together for the greater success.
D. Communication and Coordination
Furthermore, communications play a vital role in
coordination among agents, and they are critical for achieving
optimal policies. In many video games, agents operate in
partially
observable
environments,
and
effective
communication allows them to share their local observations,
forming a more comprehensive understanding of the
environment. Additionally, agents often need to make joint
actions, coordinating their efforts to execute macro-level
strategies such as coordinated attacks, defense, or resource
management [48]. Also, effective communication is essential
for aligning individual policies and making micro-level
decisions. This involves sharing local observations, intentions,
and plans in real-time.
E. Credit Assignment
The multi-agent credit assignment problem [49], [50] is
another significant challenge in MARL for video games. This
issue is especially evident in strategy games with long time
dependencies. It is challenging to track when macro-level
strategies, such as terrain control or expansion, are executed
over several minutes with hundreds of steps each minute.
Additionally, when such a macro-level strategy is successfully
completed by all agents as a team, it becomes hard to determine
the contribution of each agent to the team's success. More
specifically, designing a reward structure that appropriately
credits the series of micro-level actions taken by individual
agents remains a complex task.
F. Scalability and Computational Efficiency
As the number of agents in a game increases linearly, the
complexity of managing their interactions increases
exponentially. Scalable algorithms are needed to handle largescale multi-agent environments. For instance, while state space
for Go is estimated at 10170 , MOBA can reach as high as
1020,000 [48]. Moreover, AlphaStar accumulated 200 years of
playing StarCraft II [23], and in Dota 2, OpenAI Five produced
~180 years of gameplay data per day with 128,000 CPU cores
and 256 GPUs. Even with the use of such extensive CPU and
GPU resources, it only supported up to 17 heroes out of 117,
equivalent to 14.57% of total capabilities [24]. In addition, the
real-time nature makes it more computationally demanding and
challenging. As discussed earlier, in StarCraft II, professional
players make up to 500 APM [45], meaning a decision is made
every 125 milliseconds. To achieve the performance, a MARL
agent must make an optimal decision close to that time.

V. MARL-BASED COMPLEXITY FRAMEWORK

VI. MARL IN TWO AGENT GAMES

A. Limitations of Traditional Approaches
Traditional approaches to classifying games typically rely
on subjective or production-oriented measures, such as
development budget, team size, or informal industry-standard
categories (AAA, AA, Indie). However, these approaches often
correlate poorly with the inherent complexity of the game from
a learning perspective. Budget and team size may indicate
production value or content volume, but they do not necessarily
reflect the strategic and cognitive difficulty presented by the
game environment. Additionally, relying on subjective
evaluations of complexity by human players is problematic, as
individual player experience, skill level, and familiarity with
game mechanics introduce variability that undermines
reproducibility and objective measurement.
In contrast, RL theory provides a structured and consistent
measure for evaluating learning difficulty. While human
cognition varies widely, RL environments are typically
formalized using MDP. This approach enables consistent
reasoning about how complex a game is to learn, play and
master.

As the simplest form of multi-agent interactions, two-agent
games also fall into the categories of cooperative, competitive,
and mixed settings [43], [44]. Among these, competitive twoagent games have the most attention, particularly when they
outperform human players. We will begin our review with twoagent games, transitioning from foundational works like
Backgammon and Go to real-time video games. While
Backgammon and Go are neither video games nor real-time
environments, they have significantly contributed to advancing
MARL research.

B. Dimensions of the Proposed Framework
To systematically assess complexity within this learningoriented context, we propose a classification based on five
fundamental dimensions derived from the MDP framework:
1) Observability: The degree to which agents can perceive
the full state of the environment at each decision point.
2) State Space: The size and format of the observation
available to the agent at each decision point, used as a
proxy for environment complexity.
3) Action Space: The number and type of actions an agent
can choose from at each decision point.
4) Reward Sparsity: The frequency and distribution of
learning feedback received by agents in response to
meaningful actions.
5) Multi-Agent Scale: The number of interacting agents in
multi-agent environments.
These dimensions capture core aspects of agentenvironment interaction and form an effective framework for
evaluating game complexity from a learning perspective.
C. Scope and Limitations
Real-time video games represent some of the most
challenging environments for agents to learn, as they are
typically partially observable, multi-agent, stochastic,
sequential, dynamic, continuous, and unknown [14].
Developing a comprehensive, universally applicable measure
of game complexity is therefore beyond the scope of this
review. Instead, our objective is to introduce a practical and
reproducible classification that facilitates meaningful
comparisons and deeper understanding of MARL performance
across diverse game environments.
In the following sections, we apply this MARL-based game
complexity framework to systematically review and analyze
MARL applications across various game genres, structured in
order of increasing complexity.

A. Backgammon & TD-Gammon
Backgammon is a strategic two-player game where the
objective is to move all one's checkers off the board based on
dice rolls. In 1990s, a significant breakthrough in the RL
domain was achieved with the application of temporaldifference (TD) learning to master the game [51]. Using a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, TD-Gammon
approximated the value function V(s) to predict the probability
of winning from any given game state and achieved masterlevel play that is extremely close to the world’s best human
players.
The state space in Backgammon, roughly estimated at
1020 possible configurations [51], and the action space, with
approximately 104 possible moves per turn. TD-Gammon
employed a MLP neural network, which consisted of an input
layer that processed the board configuration, followed by
hidden layers that captured the patterns of optimal play, and an
output layer that estimated the value of the position.
Additionally, its training process used self-play technique. This
allowed the system to refine strategies and policies
autonomously without human involvement. It significantly
improved training efficiency by enabling TD-Gammon to
generate its own data, accelerating learning by exploring
diverse game states and refining its strategies over time.
Central to this learning process was the TD(λ) algorithm, which
updated the network's value estimates based on the temporal
difference error function:
δ𝑡 = R 𝑡+1 + γV(s𝑡+1 ) − V(s𝑡 )

(13)

where R 𝑡+1 is the reward at time t+1 and γ is the discount
factor.
The impressive results of TD-Gammon demonstrated a
level of play competitive with top human experts, occasionally
surpassing world-class players. This pioneering integration of
RL and neural networks showcased the potential of these
techniques to handle stochastic environments. Moreover, the
success of self-play in TD-Gammon established a foundation
for MARL training processes, influencing seminal projects
such as DQN in Atari 2600 games [11] and AlphaGo [20].
B. Go & AlphaGo Series
Go is an ancient two-player competitive strategy game that
originated in China over 2,500 years ago. In the game, players
on two sides take turns placing black or white stones on a 19x19
grid to control the largest area on the board and capture the
opponent's stones. In 2016, DeepMind developed AlphaGo [20]

marked a significant milestone in applying DRL to the game.
AlphaGo combined supervised learning with RL through selfplay to learn to play the game and used Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to explore potential future moves. As a result,
it achieved a victory against the European Go champion by 5
games to 0.
In the previous section, we reviewed Backgammon, which
has a state space of 1020 . In comparison, the state space of Go
is much larger, with an estimated 10170 possible board
configurations, making it one of the most challenging board
games. The action space is also large, with hundreds of
available moves at any given turn. AlphaGo addressed these
challenges using a CNN to process the board state and a policy
network to prioritize promising moves. The training process
involved two phases: supervised learning on a dataset of 30
million positions from the KGS Go Server with an accuracy of
57.0%, and DRL through self-play. The MCTS algorithm
played a crucial role in this process by simulating numerous
future move sequences, guiding the policy network by updating
the value of each node based on simulated game outcomes.
AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero further advanced this
approach by eliminating the need for human data and relying
solely on DRL from self-play. These systems used a single
neural network to evaluate positions and select moves, learning
from scratch with the same MCTS framework. The loss
function combined policy loss and value loss to guide training:
2

𝐿(𝜃) = (𝑧 − 𝑣)2 − 𝜋𝑇 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑃 + 𝑐 ||𝜃||

(14)

where 𝑧 is the game outcome, 𝑣 is the value prediction, 𝜋 is the
MCTS-based policy, 𝑃 is the policy prediction, and 𝑐 is a
regularization parameter. This approach achieved significant
improvements, with AlphaGo Zero surpassing the original
AlphaGo, and AlphaZero generalizing the approach to other
games like Chess and Shogi.
AlphaGo's success paved the way for advancements in
MARL, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-play and the use
of CNNs within DRL to process large observation space.
Techniques from AlphaGo were widely adopted by other
games, such as StarCraft II (AlphaStar), Dota 2 (OpenAI Five)
and Honor of Kings and beyond.
C. Blade & Soul
AI research has traditionally focused on turn-based games
like Backgammon and Go, where agents have unlimited time to
compute optimal strategies using algorithms like MCTS. In
contrast, real-time games like Blade & Soul require agents to
make quick decisions continuously within milliseconds and
often with imperfect information.
As one of the real-time games, Blade & Soul (B&S),
developed by NCSOFT, is known for its fun action combat
mechanics and multiplayer environment. The game also has a
one-on-one fighting mode where two players each controls a

character and fight against each other in a given time (Fig. 3).
To explore the potential of AI in the game, the developers
integrated DRL and achieved pro-level AI agents capable of
competing against human players in this mode [52].
Unlike traditional fighting games in 2D format, B&S has a
vast action space with high dependencies between moves,
skills, and strategies in 3D. It focuses exclusively on
competitive multi-agent interactions. The neural network
architecture used for training consists of an LSTM-based model
with four heads, each responsible for different aspects of
decision-making: skill selection, movement, targeting, and
evaluation. The game’s state space includes detailed
observations such as hit points (HP), skill cooldowns, and
opponent positions, while the action space covers 44 skills,
movement, and targeting directions. The training process
utilizes an actor-critic off-policy algorithm, which handles
policy lag through truncated importance sampling. A self-play
curriculum with diverse opponent pools was developed to
ensure the agent could adapt to various competitive strategies.
Additionally, the training incorporated “data-skipping”
techniques to improve data efficiency by discarding passive
"no-op" actions, enhancing the AI agents' ability to explore and
optimize its decision-making.
The AI agents trained using this method demonstrated prolevel performance, achieving a 62% win rate against
professional gamers in the 2018 B&S World Championship.
The aggressive agent, in particular, outperformed all human
opponents in both live events and pre-tests. These results
demonstrate the potential of DRL in mastering complex realtime competitive games. The methodologies developed for
B&S can be generalized to other two-player competitive games,
providing valuable insights for future AI research and game
development [52].
The exploration of RL in two-agent games has revealed the
depth and diversity of this domain, spanning from early
successes in Backgammon with TD-Gammon to the
groundbreaking achievements of the AlphaGo series in Go, and
extending to real-time video game with Blade & Soul. To sum
up, TABLE I provides an overview of the key characteristics

and learning approaches used in the two-agent games discussed.
While competitive settings have drawn significant attention
due to their superhuman performance, it is also important to
recognize that two-agent games are not limited to competitions.
Cooperative scenarios, such as those studied in the game
Overcooked, highlight the potential for evaluating and
enhancing human-AI cooperation [53]. This area of research is
advancing the development of cooperative agents in game AI,
such as companion NPCs, and includes studies focused on
cooperative play between AI and human players.
VII. MARL IN MULTI-AGENT GAMES
Building on the discussion of two-agent games, we now turn
our attention to multi-agent environments involving more than
two agents. Unlike two-agent scenarios, these games often
require coordination within teams. As detailed in Section V, we
use a MARL-based framework to estimate game complexity
ordered by increasing learning complexity. A summary of this
classification is provided in Fig. 4 and TABLE II.

A. Competitive and Sports Games
Competitive and sports games are characterized by their
structured, rule-based gameplay and emphasis on immediate
objectives, such as scoring points or winning matches. Unlike
genres that require long-term strategic planning or navigation
through complex environments, competitive and sports games
focus on precision, timing, and execution within more confined
settings. Players in these games operate under clear, welldefined rules, engaging in fast-paced actions that require quick
decision-making and coordination. The environments are
typically simpler and more predictable than other genres with
combat gameplay, allowing for a direct, skill-driven experience
where success is determined by the player's ability to adapt
rapidly to the game’s immediate demands.
1) 3v3 Snake
As one of the well-known real-time games, 3v3 Snake extends
the classic Snake game into a multi-agent environment. In its
general mode, multiple teams of snakes compete to grow the
longest by consuming beans while avoiding collisions with
themselves, their teammates, or their opponents. In one study
[54], the game is configured with two teams of three snakes each
on a 10x20 fully observable map with toroidal boundaries,
where a snake that crosses one edge of the map reappears on the
opposite edge, with this wrapping behavior applied to both
horizontal and vertical boundaries. 3v3 Snake is particularly
suitable for MARL research, presenting interesting puzzles
related to both teamwork and competition with a simple fully
observable environment.
The AI development for 3v3 Snake uses a rule-enhanced
MARL algorithm that integrates traditional rule-based strategies
with advanced RL techniques [54]. Its neural network
architecture is built using eight residual blocks, each containing
two 3x3 convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and
decision-making. This architecture supports both the policy
network, which guides the snakes' actions, and the value
network, which evaluates the game state, sharing a common

10

structure. The observation space is represented by a 12-channel
matrix, capturing key game elements such as snake positions,
bean locations, and a territory matrix that incorporates humanderived rules. The action space is limited to 4 directional
movements with the opposite direction always being illegal. Its
training process employs Distributed PPO across 20 actor
processes and one learner. A novel aspect of this approach is the
integration of the territory matrix within the MARL framework,
allowing the AI agents to apply human-like strategic insights.
In the context of MARL, 3v3 Snake provides a collaborative
environment so they must learn to cooperate within their team
while simultaneously competing and defending the opposing
team. The rule-enhanced MARL algorithm developed for this
game demonstrates the importance of integrating humandesigned rules with learned policies to achieve superior
performance. The trained agents consistently outperform both
rule-based algorithms and human players, highlights the
potential of 3v3 Snake for future MARL research.
2) Google Research Football
Google Research Football (GRF) is a physics-simulated 3D
video game designed to replicate professional football (soccer)
as shown in Fig. 5. It supports all major actions seen in a real
football game and is highly customizable and flexible for RL
research. The environment allows researchers or players to
either control an entire team of players as a single agent or
engage in MARL scenarios where multiple agents manage
different players on the same team.
The platform is also optimized for computational efficiency,
incorporates stochastic elements, and is integrated with
commonly known RL models, while also supporting
cooperative MARL elements such as agent communication. In
this environment, opponents can be either built-in AI bots or
other trained agents in multiplayer settings, providing a versatile
and challenging context for the development and evaluation of
RL and MARL algorithms.
The GRF environment offers an observation space
composed of three distinct representations: Pixels, Super Mini
Map (SMM), and Floats. The Pixel representation consists of a
1280×720 RGB image processed by a CNN. The SMM utilizes
four 72×96 binary matrices to capture positional information
about players, the ball, and the active player. Lastly, the Floats
representation provides a compact 115-dimensional vector of
key game metrics, such as player coordinates, ball possession
and direction, active player, and game mode. This diversity in
observation allows researchers to experiment with varying
levels of abstraction in agent training. The action space is
discretized, encompassing movement in 8 directions, passing,

shooting, sprinting, sliding, and dribbling. GRF implements two
reward functions: the SCORING function rewards agents based
on successful goals, while CHECKPOINT addresses the reward
sparsity of SCORING by offering intermediate rewards as the
ball progresses toward the opponent’s goal. For training, GRF
integrates three state-of-the-art RL algorithms: IMPALA [55],
PPO [41], and Ape-X DQN [56]. Additionally, GRF includes
the “Football Academy”, a suite of predefined scenarios that
progressively increase in difficulty, allowing agents to
systematically train and refine their skills.
In the context of MARL, GRF environment supports both
cooperative and competitive multi-agent setups, ranging from
small-scale scenarios to full 11 vs. 11 matches. It provides a
versatile and computationally efficient platform for advancing
RL and MARL with a rich and diverse observation space, welldefined action space, and hierarchical reward structures. Its
integration of state-of-the-art algorithms and structured training
scenarios makes it a valuable tool for developing and testing
MARL in a realistic football simulation.
3) Ubisoft’s Roller Champions
In addition to GRF, another significant platform is the Unity
ML-Agents Toolkit [57]. A notable game of its application is
Roller Champions, a third-person perspective, fast-paced,
team-based competitive multiplayer sports game developed by
Ubisoft. In the game, players skate around an oval-shaped arena
with the objective of scoring goals by throwing a ball through a
hoop. Similar to other sports games, it emphasizes skill-driven
gameplay centered around one objective (the ball) with clearly
defined rules. The game features both coordination and
competition, as players must pass the ball, defend, and position
themselves strategically to complete laps and score points.
To enhance player experience, the developers integrated
MARL into Roller Champions AI systems with the goal of
creating agents that can effectively compete against and
collaborate with human players [58]. The system was not
designed solely to achieve superhuman performance but to
contribute to the overall enjoyment of the game by fostering
cooperative strategies, maintaining game balance, adapting to
different levels of player skill, and replacing players when they
disconnect. This practical implementation of MARL features
very efficient deployment and training processes. This allows
the AI agents to quickly adapt gameplay and balance changes,
supporting rapid agile game development. By focusing on fun
and varied gameplay rather than just win rates, its AI systems
contribute to a more immersive and rewarding experience for
players across all game modes. Moreover, this practical
approach to diversified MARL research sets valuable examples
for other researchers and developers, demonstrating how MARL
can be effectively integrated into modern game design to
enhance both player engagement and development efficiency.
The AI system for Roller Champions utilizes PPO as its core
learning algorithm, with a policy network consisting of three
layers, each with 512 neurons. The decision interval is set at 15
Unity's FixedUpdates [59], corresponding to 0.02 seconds per
update under default settings. Training is conducted through
self-play across 3–15 simultaneous environments against a wide
range of strategies and skill levels. The process is balanced
between efficiency and performance, allowing for the rapid
development of new models. Overall, it takes only 1–4 days to

produce a new model following gameplay or balance changes,
making this approach highly suitable and practical for fastpaced, agile game development in a live service game.
The observation space is derived directly from the game
state. Relevant game entities are always observed, including the
ball, opponents, allies, goals, checkpoints, and laps. For each
entity, key data points such as relative position, speed, and clear
line-of-sight flags are observed. For players, flags indicating
whether they are hurt, in air, or performing certain actions are
included. The agent also observes its own position, state, and
speed. To further enhance stability during training, Action
Masking is used to eliminate infeasible actions. The reward
structure is designed to incentivize game progress and
teamwork, with scaled rewards for checkpoint completion and
goals, complemented by penalties for opposing team successes
to encourage competitive and cooperative behaviors. As an
example, Fig. 6 shows the cooperative and competitive
behavior from a trained agent. Agents can strategically position
themselves in offensive or defensive roles depending on the
game state.
Additionally, agents are designed for multi-purpose
functionality, operating across different game modes, including
competitive and practice settings. In the mode "Training with
Bots," the agent adjusts difficulty levels to accommodate
various player skills, and in classic live matches, it seamlessly
replaces human players who have disconnected, using lower
difficulty models to maintain balance and ensure a smooth
gameplay experience. Moreover, this system represents a
practical step in game production, providing a scalable and
efficient AI solution that enhances both gameplay and
development processes.
4) Rocket League
Rocket League is a fast-paced vehicular soccer game where
players control rocket-powered cars to score goals in an arena
similar to a soccer field, combining elements of soccer strategy
with driving mechanics. The game is primarily played in 2 vs.
2 or 3 vs. 3 team formats, where players coordinate with their
teammates to maintain possession of the ball, defend their goal,
and create scoring opportunities (Fig. 7). The core gameplay
involves driving, jumping, boosting, and performing aerial
maneuvers to outplay opponents, making each match a
combination of skill and strategy.
Building on this interest in sports-like games for RL

Fig. 7. A screenshot from a 2 vs 2 match in Rocket League shows cars
competing to hit the ball toward the goal in a soccer-like arena. The

user interface.

research, Rocket League serves as an effective platform due to
its combination of balanced gameplay, clearly defined
competitive and cooperative interactions, and a structured,
intuitive soccer-like environment. As discussed earlier, Roller
Champions utilized the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit [57] for
studies in MARL. Similarly, the same toolkit is utilized to adopt
a two-agent approach for training AI agents in specialized tasks
such as goalkeeping and striking in Rocket League [60]. This
research illustrates the efficacy of sim-to-sim transfer. In the
context of MARL, another work highlights the potential of
Rocket League for developing team-based AI by leveraging its
dynamic role-switching mechanics, where roles such as
attacker, receiver, and defender are continuously reassigned
based on game states, enabling agents to adapt and coordinate
effectively in real-time [61]. The paper also examines the
opportunities for advancing tactical decision-making processes,
where agents analyze player positions, ball trajectories, and
dynamic team formations to refine both offensive and defensive
strategies. Furthermore, it explores the game's potential to
facilitate human-bot collaboration through the development of
more sophisticated real-time communication protocols that
could enhance coordination among agents. The scalability of
Rocket League to accommodate varying team sizes and
configurations makes it an attractive environment for
researching complex multi-agent interactions.
More recently, Lucy-SKG [62] was introduced as an AI
agent developed to advance learning and performance in the
Rocket League environment. Unlike earlier work that focused
on specific tasks, such as training AI agents for specific roles
like goalkeeper or striker, Lucy-SKG employs a more holistic
approach by integrating novel methodologies that enhance both
individual abilities and coordinated team-based play. Central to
its design is the Kinesthetic Reward Combination (KRC)
technique, which refines the reward signals to better represent
complex cooperative and competitive in-game behaviors, such
as maintaining optimal positioning and controlling the ball with
precision in dynamic situations. Additionally, Lucy-SKG
utilizes auxiliary tasks, such as state prediction and reward
estimation, which act as supplementary objectives to regularize
the learning process. These auxiliary tasks improve sample
efficiency by guiding the agent to learn a broader range of
representations about the game environment, ultimately

12
ToG-2024-0292.R1
facilitating more effective decision-making in multi-agent
previously leading bots, Necto and Nexto, the research
demonstrates that Lucy-SKG achieves superior learning
efficiency and gameplay performance.
Lucy-SKG utilizes a portion of the state space available
through RLGym [63], a python API to treat the game as an
OpenAI Gym environment. It is structured as a triplet that
includes a latent array containing player-specific information, a
byte array representing key game objects to focus on, and a key
padding mask to accommodate varying numbers of players. The
action space consists of 90 discrete action combinations,
encompassing various actions. At the core of the learning
process, the agent uses KRC as an alternative to linear reward
combinations designed to measure the utility of complex
phenomena by creating a compound reward signal that reflects
high-level state quality. The KRC balances multiple reward
components, enabling the learning of complex skills such as
aligning the ball toward the goal while maintaining a close
distance, and offers potential for further generalization in future
work. Additionally, to better facilitate learning in cooperative
multi-agent settings, the reward function incorporates a reward
distribution function:
𝑅𝑖′ = (1 − 𝜏) ∗ 𝑅𝑖′ + 𝜏 ∗ 𝑅′𝑡𝑒𝑎𝑚 − 𝑅′𝑜𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑛𝑡

(15)

that considers team spirit that encourages coordination.
Furthermore, to enhance learning efficiency and performance,
Lucy-SKG has auxiliary neural architectures trained on reward
prediction and state representation tasks. These auxiliary tasks
are designed to improve the agent's understanding of the
environment by predicting future rewards and representing
states more effectively. The training is conducted in an onpolicy fashion, integrating these tasks with the main learning
objective to accelerate learning speed and overall performance.
Finally, the agent's neural network architecture is based on a
Perceiver model with cross-attention mechanisms, which
leverages MLPs and Transformers [64] to process highdimensional state inputs and learn representations that account
for the interdependencies between agents. The architecture is
trained using PPO. Through a series of ablation studies, the
research demonstrates that the combination of KRC, auxiliary
tasks, and PPO enhances the agent's learning speed and overall
performance, establishing a new benchmark for game AI in
Rocket League's multi-agent setting.
B. First-Person Perspective Games
First-person perspective (FPP) games, a superset of firstperson shooter (FPS) games, are among the most popular
genres in video games. Unlike isometric or top-down view
strategy games, where AI agents manage multiple entities, FPP
games set the player or AI agents in a first-person view and
operate as a single entity navigating a 3D virtual world. This
immersion closely mirrors human sensory experiences, making
FPP games particularly relevant for applications requiring realtime decision-making from a first-person viewpoint. The
challenges of FPP games mostly come from their partially
observable environments. Additionally, these games often have
more interactions with the environment, such as opening doors
or hiding behind covers, which add complexity to gameplay and

agent learning processes. Moreover, the continuous action
spaces and high-dimensional visual inputs characteristic of FPP
games further elevate the difficulty. By tackling these complex
gameplay and AI challenges, research in FPP games can drive
innovation in creating more adaptive and intelligent agents,
enhancing both AI performance in real-world applications and
game experiences with more responsive, human-like game AI.
1) Doom & ViZDoom
Doom is a well-known FPS video game released in 1993
that has significantly influenced the genre. In the game, players
play the role of a space marine in first person view, navigating
through a series of maze-like levels in military bases on Mars
and Hell as shown in Fig. 8. The primary objective is to
eliminate demonic enemies using a variety of weapons while
collecting health packs, ammunition, and key cards to unlock
new areas.
Doom also introduced a multiplayer mode, which includes
cooperative gameplay and competitive deathmatch scenarios.
In cooperative mode, players work together to complete levels
by defeating enemies and achieving shared goals. In
competitive deathmatch, players face off against each other in
fast-paced battles to achieve the highest score by eliminating
opponents. In recent years, a modified version ViZDoom [65]
has become a prominent toolkit and environment for
experimenting and developing RL algorithms in FPP
environments. ViZDoom provides a 3D, FPP setup, allowing
researchers to develop and test AI agents that play using only
raw visual pixel input. This platform also supports a variety of
scenarios, from basic target shooting to complex navigation and
survival tasks. Notably, the multiplayer Deathmatch mode in
ViZDoom has been popular in studying MARL [66].
The research in Doom and ViZDoom integrates CNNs with
RL to manage observations similar to human vision. The action
space in ViZDoom includes discrete actions such as moving,
shooting, and navigating through levels. The reward strategy
in these environments typically involves a combination of
shaping positive and negative rewards, such as points for killing
an opponent or penalties for self-damage.
One notable study is the development of the F1 agent [67],
using Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) [68]
algorithm to train agents in the Deathmatch mode. The training
process incorporated curriculum learning, starting with simple
environments and progressively increasing the difficulty by
introducing more challenging maps and stronger opponents.
This approach resulted in the F1 agent achieving state-of-theart performance, including winning Track 1 of the ViZDoom

13
ToG-2024-0292.R1
AI Competition with a score 35% higher than the second-place
competitor.
In conclusion, Doom and ViZDoom are excellent platforms
to begin exploring MARL in FPP/FPS settings. Their relatively
straightforward rules and moderate complexity make them ideal
environments for developing and testing MARL algorithms
before tackling more complex first-person view games.
2) Minecraft
As one of the most-played video games in the world,
Minecraft has a giant open-world sandbox-style environment
for players to explore, gather resources, craft tools, and build all
kinds of complex structures (Fig. 9). It is also known for its
multiplayer mode, where a world is shared among different
players. In Minecraft, players begin by collecting basic
materials such as wood and stone, which they use to create tools
and shelters. As they progress, they can mine for rarer
resources, build increasingly sophisticated structures, and
engage in interactions like farming, trading, and combat.
The game’s flexibility allows for a wide range of gameplay
styles, making it a perfect platform for mixed-setting MARL
research. In particular, cooperation happens when players
working together to build large buildings, defend against ingame threats, or manage shared resources. On the other hand,
competition is also a core aspect of multiplayer gameplay.
Players or teams may compete to dominate resources,
outperform one another in construction, or engage in direct
combat. More interestingly, the roles are not always fixed,
meaning players can switch between collaboration and
competition, creating an unpredictable multiplayer experience
and a mixed setting in MARL context.
Several research initiatives have utilized Minecraft to
explore different aspects of AI, particularly in enhancing multiagent interactions. One such effort involves using Minecraft as
a simulated task environment (STE) to improve collaboration
between human players and rule-based AI agents [69]. Another
work done is the creation of BurlapCraft [70], a Minecraft mod
developed to integrate with the BURLAP RL and planning
library. BurlapCraft's integration with Minecraft enables AI
agents to perform tasks such as navigation, block placement,
and even language understanding, within a richly interactive 3D
environment. Furthermore, the MineRL project [71] introduces
a large-scale dataset of over 60 million state-action pairs of
human demonstrations across various tasks in Minecraft. To
capture the diversity of gameplay and player interactions,
MineRL includes six tasks that present a range of research
challenges, including open-world multi-agent interactions,
long-term planning, vision, control, and navigation, as well as
both explicit and implicit subtask hierarchies. These tasks are
implemented as sequential decision-making environments
within an existing Minecraft simulator. Additionally, the
MineRL project features a novel platform and methodology for
the continuous collection of human demonstrations. As users
play on the publicly available MineRL server, their gameplay
is recorded at the packet level, allowing for perfect
reconstruction of each player’s view and actions. This platform
not only supports the ongoing expansion of the dataset with new
tasks but also facilitates automatic annotation, making it a
valuable resource for advancing AI research in complex,
dynamic environments like Minecraft.

Moreover, the developers of Minecraft, Microsoft,
introduced Project Malmo [72], an AI experimentation platform
built on top of the game to support a wide range of research in
areas such as computer vision, RL/MARL, and robotics. It
offers an abstraction layer and API on top of Minecraft, where
multiple agents can interact with the environment by perceiving
observations and rewards and taking actions in real-time. In
2017, Microsoft organized the Malmo Collaborative AI
Challenge (MCAC) [73], aimed at advancing research in
MARL through a collaborative mini-game within Minecraft. A
notable champion of this challenge was HogRider [74].
HogRider was specifically designed to navigate the
complexities of the Pig Chase mini-game, where agents either
collaborate to catch a pig or deviate from cooperation to pursue
individual gains. The developers employed a novel agent type
hypothesis framework to identify and adapt to the behavior
models of other agents, and a customized Q-learning.
HogRider's performance was exceptional, winning the
challenge with a 13% higher mean score and 21.7% better
variance-to-mean ratio than the second-best team. Additionally,
it outperformed human players with a 28.1% higher mean score
and a 29.6% reduction in the variance-to-mean ratio,
demonstrating its superiority in both optimality and stability.
Furthermore, the platform has also been employed to exploring
MARL in MalmÖ (MARLÖ) Competition [75], which
specifically challenges participants to develop MARL agents
capable of generalizing across different mini-games and
opponent types within Minecraft. The MARLÖ competition
features three games: Mob Chase, a collaborative game where
agents must work together to capture a mob; Build Battle, where
teams compete to construct a specified structure; and Treasure
Hunt, a mixed cooperative and competitive game involving
resource collection and combat. These tasks are designed to
engage both collaboration and competition among agents,
highlighting the platform’s potential to advance MARL
research by fostering the development of versatile, generalpurpose agents capable of learning across diverse scenarios. To
sum up, TABLE III summarizes key features and focuses of
these platforms.
Minecraft also presents an open-ended world without
predefined win or lose conditions, closely simulating real-world
scenarios. Despite the game's limitations, such as block-like
graphics and simplified physics, its flexibility supports all three
types of MARL interactions, making it an effective platform for
studying complex multi-agent systems.

regular gameplay, its Capture the Flag (CTF) mode has
drawn attention in AI research in recent years. In this mode, two
teams of players compete to capture the opponent's flag while
defending their own within a 3D maze-like level (Fig. 10). The
game's procedurally generated environments and adjustable
map sizes offer a rich and flexible environment for studying
strategic multi-agent cooperation and competition.
As one of the most notable works in this field, DeepMind
trained MARL agents to play CTF using only pixel data and
game points as inputs [76]. These agents learned directly from
raw visual data, developing strategies for navigation, offense,
and defense in a partially observable environment in real-time.
Remarkably, the AI agents achieved performance levels that
surpassed those of strong human players in competitive
tournament settings.
In this context, their agents’ observations in the CTF mode
are closely modeled after those of human players, utilizing 84 x
84 pixel RGB frames processed through CNNs along with game
points as input. The agent's policy 𝜋𝑖 is designed to maximize
the probability of winning for its team {𝜋0 , 𝜋1 , … , 𝜋𝑁/2−1 } ,
which is composed of 𝜋0 itself and its teammates’ policies

loses, and resolves ties randomly. 𝜔 represents the specific map
instance and random seeds, which are stochastic in learning and
testing. The binary outcome of win/lose as a reward is
insufficient for effective learning due to sparse and delayed
rewards. To address this, more frequent rewards are introduced
that correspond to specific in-game events, such as capturing
the flag, picking up the flag, or having a teammate capture the
flag etc. These rewards can be utilized directly in reward

Fig. 11. The figure [76] shows the win probabilities of various AI
agents and human players in CTF mode across different map sizes,
team sizes, and environments. The FTW agents consistently achieve
the highest win probabilities, surpassing both built-in scripted bots and
human players, with over 70% win probability in most scenarios.

shaping, or they can be transformed into a reward signal
through a learned transformation function, forming the
foundation of its novel For-The-Win (FTW) agent architecture.
The architecture consists of two LSTM networks operating at
distinct timescales: the fast LSTM processes inputs such as
pixel observations, previous actions, and rewards at each
environment step, while the slow LSTM updates at a lower
frequency, capturing long-term temporal dependencies and
facilitating strategic planning. In addition, the fast LSTM
generates a variational posterior distribution, incorporating new
observations and prior knowledge from the slow LSTM, which
generates a prior distribution on the latent variable. Moreover,
the architecture is augmented with an external Differentiable
Neural Computer (DNC) memory module, which enhances the
agent's ability to store and retrieve past experiences, mimicking
episodic memory functions. Lastly, the FTW agent uses an
extensive action space consisting of 540 distinct actions,
generated by combining elements from six independent action
dimensions.
Optimization within the FTW architecture is performed
using a two-tier approach. The first tier, or inner optimization,
focuses on maximizing the agents' expected future discounted
internal rewards. Complementing this is the second tier, or outer
optimization that is managed through Population-Based
Training (PBT). PBT is an online evolutionary process,
adapting internal rewards and hyperparameters while
performing model selection. In this process, agents that
underperform are systematically replaced with mutated
versions of better-performing agents, ensuring that the
population evolves towards higher performance. The

15
ToG-2024-0292.R1
effectiveness of PBT is further enhanced by self-play and a
distributed training architecture featuring an actor-learner
structure, with 1920 parallel arena processes facilitating largescale, concurrent training.
The agents demonstrated superior performance across
various scenarios. As a result, the FTW agents consistently
outperformed human players, capturing an average of 16 more
flags per game on procedurally generated maps that neither the
agents nor the humans had previously encountered. Even when
human players were paired with FTW agents, the human-agent
teams had only a 5% win probability against a team of two FTW
agents. In a targeted test, where professional game testers had six
hours to devise exploitative strategies against the FTW agents
on a complex map, the humans could only achieve a 25% win
rate. An overview of the test results is shown in Fig. 11. The
evaluation also highlighted significant differences between the
agents and human players in terms of reaction times and tagging
accuracy. The FTW agents had a reaction time of 258
milliseconds, compared to 559 milliseconds for humans, and a
tagging accuracy of 80%, substantially higher than the 48%
accuracy of human players. Even when the FTW agents' tagging
accuracy was deliberately reduced to match human levels, they
still maintained a higher win probability. These results showcase
the effectiveness of the FTW architecture and training
methodologies, with the agents consistently outperforming both
human players and existing AI benchmarks in the CTF mode.
C. RTS and MOBA Games
Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy games,
but instead of playing in turns, RTS games allow all players to
play simultaneously in real-time. The genre is defined by
resource management, base building, and large-scale tactical
combat, typically with a top-down or isometric camera view
that gives players a broad perspective of the battlefield. Players
control multiple worker or soldier units and structures, making
real-time decisions to gather resources, build bases, and engage
in strategic combat against opponents. These games require
quick thinking and efficient management of various tasks
simultaneously. Building on this foundation, the Multiplayer
Online Battle Arena (MOBA) subgenre emerged, thriving as
one of the most popular gaming formats. MOBA games
simplify individual player actions by focusing on controlling
one single character, and shift the emphasis to team
collaboration and strategic coordination rather than
multitasking from RTS games. The camera view remains
similar, often top-down, but the gameplay centers on working
with teammates to achieve certain objectives, manage map
control, and outplay the opposing team. Both RTS and MOBA
games involve partially observable environments with fog of
war, long-term strategic planning, high APM, and coordinated
teamwork to influence the game’s outcome over long periods.
1) StarCraft II
As one of the most well-known RTS games, StarCraft II
was created by Blizzard Entertainment as a sequel to StarCraft.
Players choose one of three races, gather resources to progress,
build structures, and eventually defeat other players or AI
agents with soldier units from their chosen race. Like most RTS
games, StarCraft II is an imperfect information game where

Fig. 12. StarCraft II Minimap: it provides an overview of the entire
battlefield, allowing players to monitor key locations, track allied and
enemy movements, and quickly navigate between different areas.
Players can also ping the minimap to communicate with their team,
improving coordination.

players must rely on a combination of a local camera that limits
their view to a specific area and a minimap (Fig. 12) that
provides only a high-level overview of the battlefield.
Additionally, the fog of war obscures unobserved regions of the
map, making active exploration essential to gathering
information about the opponent’s state.
In 2017, DeepMind, in collaboration with Blizzard,
introduced the StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE), a
platform based on StarCraft II to support research on RL with
multi-agent support [45]. Using this platform, DeepMind
developed AlphaStar in 2019 [23], which reached a significant
milestone by defeating professional human players in StarCraft
II tournaments. It was rated at Grandmaster level for all three
races and above 99.8% of officially ranked human players.
The state space in StarCraft II is vast, with each game
consisting of tens of thousands of time-steps and thousands of
actions, selected in real-time throughout approximately ten
minutes of gameplay. Every second in the game, there are
typically 16 time-steps. At each step AlphaStar receives an
observation that includes a list of all observable units and their
attributes, although this information is imperfect as it includes
only opponent units that are visible to the player’s own units.
The action space in StarCraft II is highly structured, resulting
in approximately 1026 possible choices at each step.
AlphaStar's architecture involved a Transformer [64] based
neural network to process the game's extensive state space. Its
training process included supervised learning from human
expert games, followed by RL through self-play with a novel
“League Training” approach. Initially, it was trained on a
dataset of 971,000 replays from the top 22% of players, with a
fine-tuning phase using games with Matchmaking Rating
(MMR) above 6,200 while the highest is typically around
7,000, achieving a supervised learning rating above 84% of
human players. The core RL algorithm employed was a variant
of PPO for its high-dimensional action spaces.
AlphaStar’s league training approach is designed to address
the exploration-exploitation dilemma [77] in StarCraft II. The
training involves creating different leagues of agents that
compete against each other through a multi-faceted system of
main agents, main exploiters, and league exploiters. Main
agents continuously improve by playing against both current
and past versions of themselves by using Prioritized Fictitious
Self-Play (PFSP) to focus on opponents that pose the greatest

16
ToG-2024-0292.R1
challenge. Main exploiters are specifically trained to identify
and exploit weaknesses in the main agents to improve their
adaptability and resilience. League exploiters, on the other
hand, target weaknesses in the overall league. This structure can
might regress or get stuck in loops of non-transitive strategies.
This is particularly relevant in StarCraft II, which has a similar
setup with three races that counter each other. Additionally,
AlphaStar’s use of human data for initial policy training and
strategic diversity, combined with RL techniques like V-trace
and upgoing policy updates (UPGO), fosters continuous
improvement and adaptation within the league training system.
These techniques have been driving ongoing research and
innovation in MARL, inspiring new approaches to training AI
agents in other real-time environments.
In addition to the advancements made by AlphaStar, other
research efforts have also contributed to the development of
MARL in StarCraft II. A grid-wise control architecture has
been presented to address the challenges associated with
managing varying numbers of agents in spatial grid
environments [79]. This architecture enhances multi-agent
collaboration through a convolutional encoder-decoder
network that enables scalable and flexible coordination among
agents. In addition, a noval hierarchical control framework for
MARL in RTS games improves multi-agent coordination by
separating decision-making into macro-strategies at the high
level and micro-actions at the lower level [80]. This division
allows for the execution of hierarchical, coordinated strategies
that integrate strategic planning with tactical execution.
Although the StarCraft series is popular in various multiagent research studies, the majority remains focused on 1 vs. 1
competitive gameplay even though StarCraft II supports up to
12 players and can be trained using league systems or many vs.
many configurations. The extensive micromanagement
required to play StarCraft II makes the game both intense and
for many players. On the other hand, MOBA games like Dota
2 have thrived. These games emphasize 5 vs. 5 teamwork over
individual player skills with much simpler control schemes,
single-unit management and single-resource management. This
shift not only captured the attention of a broader player base but
also created a better environment for MARL research, where
the focus is on team collaboration rather than just individual
skills or APM.
2) OpenAI Five for Dota 2
Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2), developed by Valve
Corporation, is a leading title in the popular MOBA genre. The
game features two teams of five players, each controlling a
"hero" with unique skills, complemented by various equitable
items that provide passive enhancements, functionalities, and
active abilities. The primary objective is to destroy the opposing
team’s Ancient, the primary structure in their base. An example
of player’s observation in Dota 2 is shown in Fig. 13, along
with some of critical gameplay elements.
The complexity of Dota 2, characterized by its large and
partially observable environment, long game duration,
extremely sparse and delayed rewards, vast and continuous
state and action spaces, demands real-time strategic planning
and precise team coordination. Unlike traditional RTS games
like StarCraft II, which focus mainly on 1 vs. 1 gameplay and
micro-operation, Dota 2 emphasizes 5 vs. 5 teamwork, where

Fig. 13. Dota 2 Human Observation Space [24]

success depends on team coordination, macro strategies and
sequential decision-making. This shift to multi-agent
collaboration has not only resonated with the player community
but has also positioned Dota 2 as a premier platform for
advancing research in MARL. The potential of these
technologies was demonstrated in 2018 when OpenAI Five
achieved a groundbreaking victory over the world’s best human
players, Team OG, at The International 2018.
The OpenAI Five [24] system employed a large-scale DRL
approach to train AI agents to play Dota 2 at a superhuman
level. The system tackled a high-dimensional state space of
approximately 16,000 continuous and categorical variables per
time-step, while the action space required the model to select
among 8,000 to 80,000 possible actions, depending on the hero.
To manage, the training process relied on a RNN with
approximately 159 million parameters, centered around a
single-layer LSTM with 4096 units, which constituted 84% of
the model's parameters. Each hero in a team was controlled by
a replica of this network.
To mitigate the challenges posed by Dota 2’s complexity,
certain game mechanics were controlled by hand-scripted logic
rather than the policy. This included the order in which heroes
purchased items and abilities, the control of the unique courier
unit, and the management of items heroes kept in reserve.
Additionally, the system was restricted to a subset of 17 heroes
out of the 117 available in the full game, and it excluded support
for items that allow players to temporarily control multiple units
simultaneously, reducing the technical complexity and
computational demands.
The training process also utilized PPO, enhanced with
Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to stabilize and
accelerate learning. The policy optimization was conducted on
a distributed system, employing up to 1536 GPUs and
achieving a batch size of nearly 3 million time-steps per update.
Over approximately 10 months, OpenAI Five played 45,000
years of Dota 2 games using 128,000 CPU cores and 256 GPUs.
To address the challenge of long-term credit assignment, given
Dota 2’s lengthy episodes and sparse rewards, OpenAI Five
incorporated a novel reward structure that symmetrized rewards
by subtracting the opponent's rewards from the team’s,
alongside a dynamic opponent sampling system to maintain
robustness and prevent strategy collapse. Furthermore, OpenAI
Five overcame significant challenges by implementing a
continuous development process called "surgery," which
allowed for iterative improvements without restarting training.

17
ToG-2024-0292.R1
OpenAI Five also effectively addressed several
collaboration challenges such as lane assignments, hero lineup
diversity, and team incentives. Initially, agents struggled with
proper lane assignments, often clustering together and
undermining long-term strategies. A penalty system was
introduced to reinforce lane discipline, while randomized hero
lineups during training ensured the robustness across different
team compositions. Central to its MARL approach was the
"Team Spirit" hyperparameter, which managed the credit
assignment problem among the five agents. By adjusting how
rewards were shared among teammates, Team Spirit balanced
individual and collective incentives. During early training, a
lower Team Spirit reduced gradient variance, helping agents
refine their mechanical and tactical abilities. As training
progressed, increasing Team Spirit shifted the focus toward
optimizing actions for overall team success.
As a result, OpenAI Five’s success demonstrates the
potential of MARL in complex MOBA games. It competed
against 3,193 unique teams in 7,257 total games with a 99.4%
win rate, including a 2-0 victory over Team OG at The
International 2018. These outcomes highlight OpenAI Five’s
superhuman capabilities and provide valuable insights for
scenarios requiring large-scale planning, coordination, and
decision-making across multiple agents.
3) Honor of Kings
Similarly, Honor of Kings is a MOBA game played on
mobile phones (Fig. 14). It focuses on 5 vs. 5 team coordination
to destroy the opponents’ Crystal just like Dota 2. While Honor
of Kings offers a classic MOBA environment, it has further
reduced complexity compared to Dota 2, with a smaller map,
fewer hero skills, fewer active items, and typically shorter game
durations. Despite these differences, the game retains a high
level of strategic depth, making it another ideal gaming
platform for MARL.
Notably, in 2020, Tencent AI Lab developed an AI system
that achieved superhuman performance in Honor of Kings,
winning 95.2% of 42 matches against professional esports
players and 97.7% of 642,047 matches against top-ranked
human players [81]. Unlike OpenAI Five, which was limited to
supporting only 17 heroes out of 117 due to the complexity of
training across a broad hero pool, Tencent's system successfully
managed a pool of 40 heroes, representing a step toward fully
capable MOBA AI.
The AI system for Honor of Kings employs a combination
of novel and existing DRL techniques. The state space consists
of 9,227 scalar features and 6 channels of spatial features with
a resolution of 6x17x17, while the action space includes control
actions for hero movements, attacks, and use of skills. A
significant implementation is the unified actor-critic network
architecture, which captures the playing mechanics and actions
of 40 unique heroes. The architecture integrates convolutional
layers for spatial features and fully connected layers for scalar
features, combined with an LSTM to manage temporal
dependencies. The training process involves a curriculum selfplay learning (CSPL) with of three phases: fixed-lineup
training, multi-teacher policy distillation, and random-pick
training. Initially, fixed lineups are trained separately to create
teacher models. These models, with 9 million parameters each,
are then distilled into a single student model with 17 million

Fig. 14. Honor of Kings player view: player controls a single hero unit

available to the player in the top-left corner of the screen.

hero from a pool of available characters in turns.

parameters. The final phase involves training the student model
with randomly picked hero lineups from a pool of 40 heroes.
In all MOBA games, there is a phase called "drafting,"
where both teams strategically select their heroes in turns before
the game starts (Fig. 15). The choice of heroes is extremely
important to the team’s overall strategy and success as each
hero has unique abilities and strengths that can complement or
counteract other heroes. Selecting the right combination of
heroes can significantly impact the outcome of the game. In
traditional MOBA play, this phase requires deep understanding
and foresight, as teams must anticipate the opponent’s picks and
choose heroes that provide synergies with their own team while
countering the opposing team’s lineup. This drafting phase
further complicates the MARL learning process, particularly
due to the extensive combinatorial space. Given a hero pool
consisting of 40 options, the number of possible combinations
10
5
is 𝐶40
× 𝐶40
, which exceeds 1011 . Expanding this to a full
game of Honor of Kings with 113 heroes, the possible lineup
combinations increase dramatically to 1.56 × 1016 [82]. This
vast number of combinations makes a complete tree search
method, such as the Minimax algorithm used in OpenAI Five,
computationally infeasible [83].
To address the challenges associated with drafting in
MOBA games, the AI system in Honor of Kings implements
MCTS to simulate various possible hero combinations and their
outcomes. The AI system uses a value network trained on 100
million samples to predict the win rates for different hero
combinations, allowing it to evaluate and prioritize the most
effective hero combinations. In addition, the training and
execution of this sophisticated drafting strategy are supported
by substantial computational resources, including 320 GPUs

18
ToG-2024-0292.R1
and 35,000 CPUs.
The AI system in Honor of Kings marks a substantial
advancement MARL by effectively addressing the challenges
of hero selection in MOBA games. While previous systems,
such as OpenAI Five, were constrained by the complexity of
managing a limited pool of 17 heroes [24], Honor of Kings
expanded this capability to include 40 heroes. This
development not only advances the capabilities of AI in gaming
systems but also offers insights into the broader applications of
MARL in other domains.
So far, we have reviewed the applications of MARL in
games with many participants across various genres, following
the order of game complexity introduced earlier, and
emphasizing implementation details, agent interactions and
performance. To further summarize, TABLE IV provides an
overview of these findings. The next section will delve into a
discussion of the current implications and the exploration of
future directions.
VIII. DISCUSSION
While MARL has demonstrated remarkable success in
research settings, its integration into video game industry
remains limited. This section discusses the key barriers to
industrial adoption, including production constraints, design
priorities, and control requirements that differ from academic
assumptions. It also explores how these challenges affect the
application of MARL in commercial games and outlines
potential solutions that may help bridge the gap between
research and practice.
A. Industry and Academia Gap
While MARL has made significant progress in recent years
with projects like AlphaStar and OpenAI Five, the majority of
game industry has gone on a different path that focuses on
Game AI, a term referring to handcrafted, predictable, and
manageable AI behaviors. In 2014, a review highlighted that
RTS games rely on finite state machines and behavior trees
rather than advanced RL techniques [10]. This is still true for
most of game AI in the industry today. This divergence reflects
the difficulty of integrating academic AI techniques into
practical game development workflows, where predictability
and designer control take precedence over cutting-edge but
unpredictable AI behaviors. Additionally, advanced AI
techniques add significant cost to game development. On top of
development budget, lack of adaptability introduces further
expenses. These AI systems are usually developed for specific
game environments, but game developers typically need them
to work across multiple projects. One direction to bridge this
gap is the development of generalist agents capable of handling
multiple roles, modes or games. Recent work in environments
like Rocket League and Minecraft shows that agents can adapt
to dynamic roles or generalize across diverse modes.
B. Superhuman AI vs. Human-like AI
Most MARL research projects, such as AlphaStar and
OpenAI Five, measure success by how much AI surpasses
human performance. However, for video games, superhuman

AI is often undesirable, as unbeatable opponents destroy the
enjoyment and mental challenge for human players. Instead,
human-like AI can provide engaging interactions through
effective cooperation and fair competition. AI that can adapt to
player skill levels and offer a variety of interaction for both
companionship and rivalry would not only enhance game
experience but also contribute to broader AI research such as
AGI by developing agents that better understand and replicate
human behavior.
C. Creating Designer Centric RL
The game industry prioritizes AI that enhances player
experience over purely optimal solutions. Designers require
control over AI behavior to align with the game’s narrative and
aesthetic, balancing autonomy with predictability. While
behavior trees and finite state machines offer control, they limit
emergent behavior. In contrast, RL allows for adaptive agents
but is often too rigid to meet design constraints. To bridge this
gap, techniques like preference learning and potential-based
reward shaping have been proposed [84].
D. Applying AI to Other Game Genres
MARL research
has
demonstrated
superhuman
performance in genres like Sports, FPS, MOBAs and RTS.
However, other genres present completely different challenges
beyond directly competing with players. For example, in turnbased strategy games such as Civilization VI, AI is critical to
gameplay where it needs to run a human civilization as the
leader managing a variety of game systems including
diplomacy, economics, country construction, military strategy,
and resource management. In addition, each of the system has
interactions among players. Scaling RL to such genres will
boost innovations in hierarchical RL and multi-objective
optimization, contributing to smarter and more capable AI
instead of superhuman AI.
E. Accessibility for Small Game Studios
MARL is currently limited to large studios with access to
extensive resources. To push MARL in game industry,
accessible toolkits like Unity ML-Agents Toolkit and costefficient training methods are crucial. Solutions such as pretrained models, cloud-based MARL platforms, and generalpurpose algorithms will enable smaller studios to implement
advanced AI and utilize the technology to improve gaming
experience. Lowering the bar to entry will not only foster
innovation but also diversify the types of games developed with
AI, and ultimately revolutionize the industry.
IX. CONCLUSION
We review the applications of MARL across two-agent and
multi-agent games in popular genres such as sports, FPS, RTS,
and MOBA. While these implementations have pushed AI
forward, the game industry still faces challenges in adopting RL
or MARL as developers prioritize control, predictability, and
budget. With the development of AI and other technologies in
recent years, there is increasing demand for adaptive, human-
