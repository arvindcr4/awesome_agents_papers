**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Driving with RICS-Assisted MEC
**ARXIV_ID:** [arxiv id] = 2503.19418v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper presents a novel driving safety-enabled multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DS-MADRL) framework to address task offloading for autonomous vehicles (AVs), spectrum sharing strategies, and joint optimization of the reconfigurable intelligent computational surface (RICS) parameters. The proposed approach combines hybrid action space optimization with safety-driven reward design, leveraging Q-decaying DQN (DDQN) and Multi-pass DQN (MP-DQN) networks to handle discrete and continuous actions.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* A novel automated driving network system assisted by an RICS is presented, which capitalizes on multi-access edge computing (MEC) to facilitate collaborative perception and decision-making between vehicles.
* The proposed DS-MADRL framework models the optimization problem as a Markov game and solves it using a joint learning mechanism among users, introducing a cooperative learning mechanism among agents.
* The paper investigates the impact of various factors, including the transmission power of AVs, the number of V2V pairs, and the size of data to be processed by AVs, on the system performance.
* The proposed approach is compared with other algorithms, including traditional optimization algorithms and other DRL algorithms, demonstrating its superiority in terms of convergence performance and system safety.
