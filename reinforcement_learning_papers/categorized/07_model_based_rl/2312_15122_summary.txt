**TITLE:** Scaling Is All You Need: Autonomous Driving with JAX-Accelerated Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2312.15122v4
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl (Model-Based Reinforcement Learning)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper presents a hardware-accelerated autonomous driving simulator for real-world driving scenarios, which combines a scalable reinforcement learning framework with an efficient simulator. The simulator uses prerecorded real-world driving data and is accelerated using JAX, allowing for large-scale reinforcement learning experiments. The authors demonstrate the performance of their simulator and compare it to existing work, showing improved policy performance with increasing scale.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The authors demonstrate how to use prerecorded real-world driving data in a hardware-accelerated simulator as part of distributed reinforcement learning to achieve improving policy performance with increasing experiment size.
* They show that their largest scale experiments, using a 25M parameter model on 6000 hours of human-expert driving from San Francisco training on 2.5 billion agent steps, reduced the failure rate compared to the current state of the art by 64%.
* The authors provide a detailed description of their simulator, including the use of JAX for acceleration and the implementation of a distributed learning system.
* They evaluate their approach using various metrics, including failure rate and progress ratio, and compare their results to existing work in the field.
