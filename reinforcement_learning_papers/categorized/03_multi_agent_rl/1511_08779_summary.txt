TITLE: Multiagent Cooperation and Competition with Deep Reinforcement Learning
ARXIV_ID: 1511.08779v1
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper explores the use of deep reinforcement learning to train multiple agents to cooperate or compete in a complex environment, specifically the game of Pong. The authors use a decentralized approach, where each agent is controlled by an independent Deep Q-Network, and investigate how the agents learn to interact with each other under different rewarding schemes.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning in training multiple agents to cooperate or compete in a complex environment.
- The authors show that by changing the rewarding scheme, the agents can learn to exhibit different behaviors, such as competitive or cooperative strategies.
- The paper highlights the potential of deep reinforcement learning for studying the decentralized learning of multiagent systems in complex environments.
- The authors provide a detailed analysis of the agents' behavior and learning progression, including the evolution of their Q-values and the emergence of coordinated strategies.
- The paper discusses the limitations of the current approach and suggests potential future directions, such as using more advanced multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms or studying the emergence of communication codes and consensus between interacting agents.
