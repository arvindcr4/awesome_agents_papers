Abstract Snippet:
Trust Region-Based Safe Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Constraints  arXiv:2301.10923v2 [cs.LG] 24 Dec 2023  1  Dohyeong Kim1 , Kyungjae Lee2 , and Songhwai Oh1 Dep. of Electrical and Computer Engineering and ASRI, Seoul National University 2 Artificial Intelligence Graduate School, Chung-Ang University dohyeong.kim@rllab.snu.ac.kr, kyungjae.lee@ai.cau.ac.kr, songhwai@snu.ac.kr  Abstract In safety-critical robotic tasks, potential failures must be reduced, and multiple constraints must be met, such as avoiding collisions, limiting energy consumption, and maintaining balance....

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "To this end, we propose a trust region-based safe RL algorithm for multiple constraints called a safe distributional actor-critic (SDAC)."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
