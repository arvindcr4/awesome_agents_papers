Abstract Snippet:
1  Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Bipedal Locomotion: A Brief Survey  arXiv:2404.17070v6 [cs.RO] 9 Nov 2025  Lingfan Bao1 , Joseph Humphreys12 , Tianhu Peng1 and Chengxu Zhou1  Abstract—Bipedal robots are gaining global recognition due to their potential applications and the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While DRL has significantly advanced bipedal locomotion, the development of a unified framework capable of handling a wide range of tasks remains an ongoing challenge. This survey systematically categorises, comp...
