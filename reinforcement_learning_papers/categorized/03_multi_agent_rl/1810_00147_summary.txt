**PAPER:** M3 RL: Mind-Aware Multi-Agent Management Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Mind-Aware Multi-Agent Management Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1810.00147v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, where a manager learns to infer the minds of self-interested workers and assign contracts to them to maximize overall productivity. The approach combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning for joint training of agent modeling and management policy optimization.

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a mind-aware multi-agent management reinforcement learning framework (M3 RL) for solving collaboration problems among self-interested workers.
* Introduces a performance history module for agent identification and a mind tracker module for agent modeling.
* Uses high-level successor representation (SR) learning to estimate the expectation of accumulated goal achievement and bonus payment in the future.
* Employs agent-wise ε-greedy exploration to encourage the manager to understand each worker's skills and preferences.
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in modeling worker agents' minds online and achieving optimal ad-hoc teaming with good generalization and fast adaptation.
