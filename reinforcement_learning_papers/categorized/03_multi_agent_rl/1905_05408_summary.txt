**TITLE:** QTRAN: Learning to Factorize with Transformation for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1905.05408v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** QTRAN is a method for learning to factorize joint action-value functions in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. It uses a transformation to factorize the joint action-value function into individual action-value functions, allowing for more efficient and effective learning. QTRAN consists of three separate estimators: individual action-value networks, a joint action-value network, and a state-value network. The method is trained using a centralized training approach, where the agents learn to optimize their individual action-value functions while also learning to coordinate with each other.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* QTRAN is able to learn to factorize joint action-value functions in a more general and flexible way than previous methods, such as VDN and QMIX.
* QTRAN is able to handle tasks with non-monotonic characteristics, where the optimal action is not necessarily the one with the highest individual reward.
* QTRAN is able to learn to coordinate with other agents in a more effective way than previous methods, leading to better overall performance.
* QTRAN is able to handle tasks with partial observability, where the agents do not have access to the full state of the environment.
* QTRAN is able to handle tasks with multiple agents, where the agents need to learn to coordinate with each other in order to achieve a common goal.
