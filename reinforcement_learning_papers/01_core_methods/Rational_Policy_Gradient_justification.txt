Abstract Snippet:
Robust and Diverse Multi-Agent Learning via Rational Policy Gradient  Niklas Lauffer1 Ameesh Shah1 Micah Carroll1  arXiv:2511.09535v1 [cs.AI] 12 Nov 2025  Sanjit A. Seshia1 Stuart Russell1 Michael Dennis2 1  UC Berkeley  2  Google Deepmind  Abstract Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents’ policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critic...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Robust and Diverse Multi-Agent Learning via Rational Policy Gradient  Niklas Lauffer1 Ameesh Shah1 Micah Carroll1  arXiv:2511.09535v1 [cs.AI] 12 Nov 2025  Sanjit A."
