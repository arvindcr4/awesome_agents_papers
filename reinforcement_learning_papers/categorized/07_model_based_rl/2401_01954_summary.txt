**PAPER:** Word-Representability of Graphs with respect to Split Recomposition
**TITLE:** Word-Representability of Graphs with respect to Split Recomposition
**ARXIV_ID:** 2401.01954v1 [cs.DM]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper studies the word-representability of graphs using split decomposition and recomposition. The authors show that the class of word-representable graphs is closed under split recomposition and determine the representation number of the resulting graph. They also establish the word-representability of a subclass of perfect graphs, known as parity graphs.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The class of word-representable graphs is closed under split recomposition.
* The representation number of the resulting graph is determined.
* The word-representability of parity graphs is established.
* A characterization of prn-irreducible comparability graphs is provided.
* The permutation-representation number of the recomposition of prn-irreducible graphs is determined.
