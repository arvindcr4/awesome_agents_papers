**ARXIV_ID:** 2511.09171v1 [cs.MA]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a framework for learning efficient communication protocols in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems. The authors introduce three novel communication efficiency metrics (CEMs): Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI), Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI), and Topology Efficiency Index (TEI). These metrics are used to evaluate the efficiency of communication protocols in MARL systems. The authors also propose a dynamic regularization weight adjustment mechanism to balance task performance and communication efficiency.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
