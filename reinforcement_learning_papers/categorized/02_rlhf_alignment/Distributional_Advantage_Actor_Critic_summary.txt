TITLE: Distributional Advantage Actor-Critic
RESEARCH_METHOD: 02_rlhf_alignment
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The paper proposes a new algorithm called Distributional Advantage Actor-Critic (DA2C or QR-A2C), which combines advantage actor-critic with value distribution estimated by quantile regression. The algorithm replaces the critic's estimation of the value function with an estimation of the value distribution using quantile regression, allowing for more accurate and stable models. The actor remains unchanged, and the critic estimates the distribution of values directly using quantile regression.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
- The paper introduces a new algorithm, DA2C, which combines the benefits of advantage actor-critic and value distribution estimation using quantile regression.
- The algorithm is evaluated on a variety of tasks, including CartPole, MountainCar, LunarLander, and Atari, and is shown to achieve at least as good as baseline algorithms, and outperforming baseline in some tasks with smaller variance and increased stability.
- The paper provides insights into the importance of environment complexity, number of atoms, and shared/non-shared models in the performance of DA2C.
- The algorithm is compared to baseline algorithms, including A2C and QR-DQN, and is shown to have superior performance in certain environments.
