**ARXIV_ID:** 2408.13567v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel hybrid multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, called HyGen, which combines online and offline learning to achieve both multi-task generalization and training efficiency. HyGen first extracts general skills from multi-task offline datasets using a global trajectory encoder and action decoders. Then, it trains policies to select the optimal skills using a hybrid replay buffer that incorporates both offline data and online interactions.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* HyGen achieves remarkable generalization to unseen tasks by discovering general skills and learning high-quality policies.
* HyGen outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-task MARL methods, including purely online and offline methods.
* HyGen's hybrid training paradigm effectively utilizes online interactions to refine skills and improve performance.
* HyGen's dynamic CQL loss scheme mitigates the out-of-distribution problem and avoids excessive Q-value penalties.
* HyGen's ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of its components, including the linearly decreasing hybrid ratio scheme and action decoder refinement.
