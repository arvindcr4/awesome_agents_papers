**PAPER:** Ensemble-MIX
**TITLE:** ENSEMBLE-MIX: ENHANCING SAMPLE EFFICIENCY IN MULTI-AGENT RL USING ENSEMBLE METHODS
**ARXIV_ID:** 2506.02841v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel algorithm for efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) using ensemble methods. The approach combines a centralized decomposed critic with decentralized ensemble learning, leveraging ensemble kurtosis as an uncertainty measure to guide exploration. The method also introduces an architecture for uncertainty-weighted value decomposition, where each component of the global Q-function is weighted using individual agent uncertainties.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces a novel algorithm for efficient exploration in MARL using ensemble methods
* Proposes an architecture for uncertainty-weighted value decomposition
* Utilizes ensemble kurtosis as an uncertainty measure to guide exploration
* Provides theoretical results bounding the bias in the actor gradient updates
* Demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on challenging Starcraft II maps
