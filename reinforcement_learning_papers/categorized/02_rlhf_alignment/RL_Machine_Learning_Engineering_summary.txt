**PAPER:** Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Engineering Agents
**TITLE:** Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Engineering Agents
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to improve the performance of machine learning engineering (MLE) agents. The authors identify two major challenges in applying RL to MLE agents: variable-duration actions and limited feedback. To address these challenges, they propose duration-aware gradient updates and environment instrumentation to provide partial credit.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a novel RL approach to improve MLE agent performance.
* They identify and address the challenges of variable-duration actions and limited feedback in RL for MLE agents.
* They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on MLEBench, a benchmark for MLE agents.
* They show that their approach can outperform prompting large models and achieve an average improvement of 22% over baselines.
