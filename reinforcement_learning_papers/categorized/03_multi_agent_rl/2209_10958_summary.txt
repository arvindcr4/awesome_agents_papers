**TITLE:** Developing, Evaluating and Scaling Learning Agents in Multi-Agent Environments
**ARXIV_ID:** 2209.10958v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper discusses the development, evaluation, and scaling of learning agents in multi-agent environments. The authors propose a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, which includes the computation of equilibria, the development of key multi-agent skills, and the evaluation of players and strategies. They also discuss the application of multi-agent learning to real-world problems, such as cooperative AI and statistical discrimination.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning that includes the computation of equilibria, the development of key multi-agent skills, and the evaluation of players and strategies.
* They discuss the application of multi-agent learning to real-world problems, such as cooperative AI and statistical discrimination.
* The authors introduce several new concepts, including the α-Rank algorithm for evaluating players and strategies, and the concept of "autocurricula" for emergent communication in multi-agent systems.
* They also discuss the importance of scaling up multi-agent learning to larger populations and more complex environments.
* The authors highlight the potential of multi-agent learning for solving real-world problems, such as improving traffic flow, pandemic preparedness, and global trading.
