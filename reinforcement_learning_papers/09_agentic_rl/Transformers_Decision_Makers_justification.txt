Abstract Snippet:
Revisiting Some Common Practices in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning  Wei Fu 1 Chao Yu 2 Zelai Xu 2 Jiaqi Yang 3 Yi Wu 1 4  arXiv:2206.07505v2 [cs.AI] 7 Aug 2022  Abstract Many advances in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are based on two common design principles: value decomposition and parameter sharing. A typical MARL algorithm of this fashion decomposes a centralized Q-function into local Q-networks with parameters shared across agents. Such an algorithmic paradigm enables centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) and leads to efficient lear...
