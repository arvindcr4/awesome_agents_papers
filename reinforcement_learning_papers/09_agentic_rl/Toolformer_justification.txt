Abstract Snippet:
Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools Timo Schick  Jane Dwivedi-Yu  Roberto Dessì†  Maria Lomeli  Luke Zettlemoyer  Nicola Cancedda  Roberta Raileanu Thomas Scialom  Meta AI Research † Universitat Pompeu Fabra  arXiv:2302.04761v1 [cs.CL] 9 Feb 2023  Abstract Language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable abilities to solve new tasks from just a few examples or textual instructions, especially at scale. They also, paradoxically, struggle with basic functionality, such as arithmetic or factual lookup, where much simpler and smaller models excel. In this paper, we show that LMs ...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools Timo Schick  Jane Dwivedi-Yu  Roberto Dessì†  Maria Lomeli  Luke Zettlemoyer  Nicola Cancedda  Roberta Raileanu Thomas Scialom  Meta AI Research † Universitat Pompeu Fabra  arXiv:2302.04761v1 [cs.CL] 9 Feb 2023  Abstract Language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable abilities to solve new tasks from just a few examples or textual instructions, especially at scale."
- "In this paper, we show that LMs can teach themselves to use external tools via simple APIs and achieve the best of both worlds."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 09_agentic_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as agent, tool, web, matching the research direction's core themes.
