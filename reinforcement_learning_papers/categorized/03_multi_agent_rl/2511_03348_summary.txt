TITLE: Learning Communication Skills in Multi-Task Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
ARXIV_ID: 2511.03348v2
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl

METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper proposes a multi-task multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method called Multi-task Communication Skills (MCS). MCS learns a shared communication protocol across tasks with varying numbers of agents, observation spaces, and action spaces. The method uses a Transformer-based message encoder to generate messages and a prediction network to maximize mutual information between messages and actions, promoting coordinated action selection. The overall learning objective is defined as a combination of the policy loss, critic loss, and prediction loss.
