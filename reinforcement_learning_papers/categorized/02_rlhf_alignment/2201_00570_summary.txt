**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning and Hierarchical Frameworks Alignment)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** 3DPG is a multi-agent actor-critic algorithm that enables coordinated but fully distributed online learning in networked systems. It uses local policy gradients and critic updates, and it can handle imperfect communication networks with delays and losses.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* 3DPG is a novel algorithm for multi-agent reinforcement learning in networked systems.
* It provides a framework for distributed online learning with imperfect communication networks.
* The algorithm is robust to age of information (AoI) and can handle large AoI and low data availability.
* 3DPG converges to a local Nash equilibrium of Markov games.
* The algorithm outperforms MADDPG in problems that require coordinated decisions or a high degree of exploration.
