**TITLE:** Emergent Coordination and Phase Structure in Independent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2511.23315v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper studies the emergence of coordination in independent multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) without centralized critics or structural coordination biases. The authors analyze the dynamics of MARL using a phase map, which reveals three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed/disordered phase. They also identify a sharp double Instability Ridge that separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors construct a phase map of coordination and stability using two axes: cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance.
* They identify three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed/disordered phase.
* They show that kernel drift is a mechanism for MARL non-stationarity and that synchronization is required for sustained cooperation.
* They demonstrate that spontaneous coordination in decentralized MARL can exhibit phase-transition-like phenomena.
