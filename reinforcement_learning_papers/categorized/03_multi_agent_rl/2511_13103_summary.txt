**TITLE:** Transformer-Based Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Networked Systems with Long-Range Interactions
**ARXIV_ID:** 2511.13103v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper introduces STACCA, a transformer-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses the challenges of capturing long-range dependencies and generalizing across network topologies in networked systems. STACCA consists of a centralized Graph Transformer Critic and a shared Graph Transformer Actor, which learn global and local dynamics, respectively. The framework also incorporates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator to address the credit assignment problem.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces STACCA, a transformer-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for networked systems
* Addresses the challenges of capturing long-range dependencies and generalizing across network topologies
* Proposes a novel counterfactual advantage estimator to address the credit assignment problem
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of STACCA in epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks
* Shows that STACCA can generalize to networks of diverse structures and significantly larger sizes than those seen during training
