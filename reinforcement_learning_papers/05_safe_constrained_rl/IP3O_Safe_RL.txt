Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI), its potential
applications in higher education have attracted significant attention. This study investigated
how 148 students from diverse engineering disciplines and regions across China used
generative AI, focusing on its impact on their learning experience and the opportunities and
challenges it poses in engineering education. Based on the surveyed data, we explored four key
areas: the frequency and application scenarios of AI use among engineering students, its impact
on students’ learning and performance, commonly encountered challenges in using generative
AI, and future prospects for its adoption in engineering education. The results showed that more
than half of the participants reported a positive impact of generative AI on their learning
efficiency, initiative, and creativity, with nearly half believing it also enhanced their
independent thinking. However, despite acknowledging improved study efficiency, many felt
their actual academic performance remained largely unchanged and expressed concerns about
the accuracy and domain-specific reliability of generative AI. Our findings provide a first-hand
insight into the current benefits and challenges generative AI brings to students, particularly
Chinese engineering students, while offering several recommendations—especially from the
students' perspective—for effectively integrating generative AI into engineering education.

1. Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, has gained
significant attention for its innovative capabilities. By leveraging deep learning, generative AI
creates diverse content, including text, images, audio, and video, excelling in creative and
interactive tasks [1]. In education, it offers immense potential for personalized learning, instant
feedback, and assistance in tasks like data analysis, literature review, and report writing, thereby
enhancing learning outcomes [2, 3, 4, 5]. Its ability to support complex problem-solving and
research development through precise outputs and simple instructions makes it a transformative
tool, particularly in engineering education [6, 7, 8].
Engineering education is founded on an integration of multiple disciplines such as engineering,
science, technology, and mathematics [9, 10]. It connects theoretical concepts to real-world
applications [11]. Traditional engineering education often emphasizes theory-based teaching
and ignores students' initiative in the learning process, which falls short in helping students
develop practical problem-solving skills. Self-determination theory states that learners’
intrinsic motivation will be enhanced by satisfying the three psychological needs of autonomy,
competence, and relatedness, thereby improving learning engagement and effectiveness [12,13].
Generative AI significantly enhances engineering education by addressing gaps in traditional
theory-driven teaching and meeting these three psychological needs through adaptive learning
that provides personalized learning paths.
While generative AI holds great promise, its integration into education also raises critical
ethical and pedagogical concerns. Issues such as plagiarism, academic integrity, and fairness in
1

assessment have become increasingly prominent [14, 15, 16]. It is widely recognized that
generative AI tools have been misused to produce unoriginal content, raising questions about
how to detect and prevent such practices effectively. Although tools like GPT Zero and
Originality AI have been developed to identify AI-generated text, their accuracy remains
inconsistent [16].
Although generative AI is capable of learning from substantial amounts of data, their training
data might contain inherent biases, inaccurate content, or outdated information that can be
replicated in the generated content. Consequently, the output generated by generative AI tools
may not always be accurate, especially in engineering disciplines that are highly technical and
demand a high degree of accuracy, and the incorrect output might lead to misleading
comprehension for students. Therefore, how to ensure that students possess adequate judgment
when employing AI tools and avoid blindly accepting AI-generated content has emerged as an
urgent problem to be addressed [17, 18, 19]. In addition, students' over-reliance on AI tools
may lead to a deterioration in independent thinking, which contradicts the core objective of
engineering education to cultivate critical thinking [9]. Therefore, how to effectively
incorporate generative AI in educational practice while avoiding its potential negative effects
is a question worthy of in-depth discussion.
Effectively addressing these issues is essential for defining the role of generative AI in
engineering curricula in higher education. Institutions and educators must develop
comprehensive guidelines and encourage responsible AI use, guiding students to utilize AI
tools effectively and ethically while fostering innovative learning and teaching models [3, 20].
Achieving this goal requires educators to adopt informed strategies grounded in a thorough
understanding of how engineering students currently engage with AI.
Although previous studies have explored the role of generative AI in teaching [21,22], there is
still a lack of systematic analysis on how it affects students' learning initiative, critical thinking,
and self-cognition, especially in the field of engineering education that focuses on practical
applications. Furthermore, technology adoption is not only a choice at the tool level, but also a
reflection of the interaction between learning motivation, educational culture, and social norms
[23,24,25]. In this regard, how engineering students use generative AI and how generative AI
is embedded in their daily learning process needs to be understood in the context of the specific
Chinese social culture and engineering education system. Therefore, the significance of this
study is to fill the current empirical research gap on the impact of generative AI on Chinese
students' learning behavior and motivation in engineering education. While this study does not
aim to propose new theoretical concepts, its valuable data and observations contribute to a
deeper understanding of established pedagogical theories and may also inform the development
of new theories in this field.
By analyzing questionnaire data from diverse academic backgrounds, the study evaluates
students’ perceptions of AI use, highlights key challenges currently encountered by them, and
proposes effective integration strategies for engineering curricula. The scope of the study
covers students' frequency of use of AI, purpose of use, perceived impact on their learning
behaviors and outcomes, and commonly encountered challenges. Specifically, it addresses the
following research questions:
(1) How frequent and in what ways are engineering students in China utilizing generative
AI?
(2) What is the impact of generative AI on the learning experience of Chinese engineering
students?
(3) What challenges do Chinese engineering students currently face when using generative
AI, and what are their expectations for its integration into engineering education?

The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of current
application of generative AI and related educational theories. Section 3 details the design and
sampling strategy of the questionnaire survey. Section 4 presents the reliability and validity
analysis of the collected survey data. Section 5 quantitatively presents and discusses the survey
results. Section 6 discusses the theoretical and practical implications of this study, outlines the
study’s limitations, and proposes future research directions. Section 7 concludes the study.
2. Literature review
With the advancement of AI technologies, generative AI has attracted significant attention
across a range of academic and professional disciplines [26]. Powered by models such as the
Transformer architecture, generative AI can automatically produce diverse forms of content,
including text, images, and audio, based on input data, and is capable of simulating human-like
reasoning and expression to a considerable extent [27]. Its integration into real-world
applications is already evident across numerous industries. For instance, generative AI supports
personalized learning in education [4, 5], diagnostic assistance in healthcare [28],
environmental pollution assessment in environmental engineering [29], and infrastructure
damage evaluation in the construction sector [30, 31].
In the education sector, the ability of generative AI to deliver personalized and adaptive learning
experiences gives it unique advantages. It enables a broad array of learning opportunities such
as real-time feedback, automated teaching resource generation, adaptive content delivery, and
interactive learning environments, all of which contribute to a more engaging and customized
educational experience [9, 32, 33]. For example, Museanu (2024) [34] reported that AI-driven
translation tools and interactive platforms significantly enhanced student engagement and
accelerated foreign language acquisition. Similarly, an exploratory study by Sun and Deng [35]
involving 70 U.S. business students found that ChatGPT improved task efficiency and user
satisfaction. However, its effectiveness was influenced by students’ prior experience and the
design of instructional prompts.
Generative AI also facilitates problem-based and collaborative learning through hands-on
activities that encourage students to actively apply theoretical knowledge in practical contexts
[36]. By supporting the development of critical thinking, reflective communication, and
problem-solving skills, generative AI helps prepare students for complex future challenges [32,
33]. Furthermore, it strengthens students’ understanding of abstract engineering concepts and
boosts engagement in experimental and design-based projects by promoting active and
reflective learning practices [37, 38, 39].
As generative AI continues to expand in educational settings, feedback mechanisms have
emerged as a critical area of research. The value of immediate feedback was recognized as early
as 1981 when psychologist Skinner [40] proposed reinforcement learning theory, which
emphasizes that learning efficiency is greatly enhanced by timely and targeted feedback. He
advocated for structured instructional designs that provide feedback at each step of the learning
process. However, delivering real-time feedback to large groups of students remains a challenge
for educators. In response, recent advances in automated feedback systems have been promising.
For example, Escalante et al. [41] applied generative AI to offer multi-dimensional suggestions
in automated writing evaluation systems, while Hao et al. [42] developed AI-based grading
tools. Nonetheless, these systems often fall short in providing deep cognitive insights,
particularly in helping students identify and address core issues in argumentative writing [43,
44]. A potential path forward lies in blending human expertise with generative AI feedback to
enhance the quality and depth of student support.
In parallel, various educational theories have been used to understand and enhance AI's role in
learning. Constructivist learning theory, for example, views learning as an active process of
3

knowledge construction through exploration, reflection, and critical inquiry [45, 46]. Based on
this theory, Winkler et al. [47] examined how constructivist approaches support students in
solving problems independently. Banihashem et al. [48] extended this work by designing an
instructional model that integrates constructivist principles with learning analytics, effectively
addressing issues related to low student engagement and poor self-regulated learning.
Self-determination theory [12, 13] is especially relevant in engineering education, as it
emphasizes the importance of fulfilling learners’ psychological needs for autonomy,
competence, and relatedness. These needs can be supported by generative AI through adaptive,
personalized, and interactive learning environments. In addition, frameworks such as the
technology acceptance model (TAM) [49, 50] and multiple intelligences theory [51] have also
been widely applied to evaluate students’ attitudes toward AI tools and their perceived
effectiveness in diverse educational contexts.
3. Methodology
3.1 Questionnaire Design
This study employs an anonymized questionnaire survey (n = 148) to examine the use of
generative AI among Chinese engineering students, evaluate their perceptions, summarize their
encountered challenges and explore its potential future integration into engineering curricula in
higher education. The quantitative survey data provide a broad understanding of usage patterns
on generative AI's role in engineering education in China.
To ensure a diverse sample, the study includes participants from multiple geographical regions
within China, representing various institution types (e.g., double first-class universities, general
universities, vocational colleges), engineering disciplines (e.g., computer science related fields,
civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering etc.), and educational levels
(undergraduate and postgraduate).
The questionnaire mainly consists of 21 scale-based questions (provided in Appendix A) for
precise quantification, 7 multiple-choice questions for specific information collection, and one
open-ended question to allow respondents to share insights not anticipated in closed questions.
These exclude questions related to participant’s basic details such as gender, age, location,
institution type, and major.
The scale-based questions are grouped into five variables:
(1) Frequency of generative AI use across scenarios
(2) Preference of using generative AI in complex problem-solving
(3) Impact of generative AI on individual learning capabilities
(4) Challenges and concerns about generative AI
(5) Perspectives on future applications of generative AI
3.2 Sampling strategy
The experiment protocol of this study was approved by the University Research Ethics Review
Panel of Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University on 21 September 2024. The survey was
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
The study employed a combination of purposeful sampling and convenience sampling.
Purposeful sampling is used to ensure representation from different institution types and
4

different engineering disciplines (e.g., mechanical engineering, electrical engineering,
computer science). Convenience sampling is used to obtain a broad range of responses from
an easily accessible student population. Our sample consisted of 148 engineering students
(n=148). The data were collected between October 9, 2024, and November 1, 2024, through
both offline and online participation, with informed consent obtained from all participants. Each
participant agreed to participate in the study knowing the purpose of the experiment and how
their personal information would be used. The sampling strategy employed in this study is wellsuited and adequate for its main objective of exploring the overall impact of generative AI on
the learning behaviors and academic performance of Chinese engineering students. A
discussion on alternative sampling approaches is also discussed in Section 6.3.
As shown in Table 1, the survey included 72 undergraduates and 76 postgraduates from diverse
engineering disciplines in various geographical representations in China. The samples included
94 male (63.51%) and 54 female (36.49%) participants.
4. Reliability and validity analysis of surveyed data
Internal consistency reliability measures the degree of correlation among items within a
questionnaire, typically assessed using Cronbach’s α coefficient [52], which ranges from 0 to
1. A higher α value signifies stronger correlations between items and better internal consistency.
α > 0.8 indicates excellent internal consistency (items are highly correlated and measure the
same underlying construct). 0.7 ≤ α ≤ 0.8 suggests good internal consistency, which is reliable
for research and application. 0.6 ≤ α < 0.7 infers acceptable reliability, which is usable but may
require refinement. α < 0.6 highlights poor internal consistency, which needs revision.
In this study, 21 scale-based questions, within the five categorized variables, were analyzed for
reliability. Cronbach’s α was calculated for each of the five variables in the SPSS® Statistics
software. The calculated Cronbach’s α values for all variables exceeded 0.8 with an overall
value of 0.879, confirming strong internal consistency across variables.

Following the reliability analysis, the validity of the questionnaire was assessed through the
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test [53] and the Bartlett’s test [54]. The KMO test measures the
adequacy of sampling for factor analysis. KMO values of 0.9 or above are considered very
suitable, 0.8 to 0.9 are good, 0.7 to 0.8 are acceptable, and below 0.6 indicate poor suitability
for factor analysis. Bartlett’s tests test the null hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an
identity matrix (no correlation among variables). If the p-value is less than 0.05, the null
hypothesis is rejected, indicating that factor analysis can be performed.
The results of these two tests are shown in Table 2. The KMO value of 0.867 indicates good
suitability for factor analysis. In the Bartlett’s test, the p-value is 0.000, which is significant (p
< 0.05), rejecting the null hypothesis and confirming that factor analysis is appropriate. These
results demonstrate that the questionnaire data exhibit strong validity, enabling factor analysis
with confidence.
5.Result
5.1 Frequency and purpose of using generative AI by Chinese engineering students
5.1.1 Popularity of adopted generative AI tools
A significant portion of respondents reported first encountering generative AI within 1-2 years
(i.e., 2023-2024). This reflects the rapid advancements in AI technology and its growing
integration into educational and social contexts over the past couple of years in China. As the
technology matures and its applications expand, more students have become aware of its
potential and have started using it.
As shown in Figure 1, among various generative AI tools, ChatGPT was by far the most popular,
with 77.03% of respondents using it. Its widespread adoption can be attributed to its powerful
capabilities, user-friendly interface, and effectiveness in text generation and interaction.
Following ChatGPT, Baidu’s Wenxin Yiyan, which was particularly favored by Chinese
engineering students, was used by 41.89% of respondents, likely due to its cultural and
language advantages. Tools like DeepL (25.68%), Microsoft Bing (20.27%) and Google Bard
(18.92%) also maintained a notable presence, especially for tasks like translation and search
optimization. In contrast, tools such as DALLꞏE, Canva AI, Adobe Firefly, and others were less
commonly used, each having usage rates around or below 10%, suggesting that their functions
are not as aligned with the needs of engineering students in China.
It is worthwhile acknowledging that new generative AI tools have been rapidly emerging since
the survey was completed in November 2024. A prominent example is DeepSeek, which has
gained significant popularity, particularly in China. This development is likely to influence the
AI tool preferences of Chinese engineering students. Nevertheless, the findings of this study
remain valid, as the capabilities of these newly introduced tools are largely comparable to those
of existing ones.

Figure 1. Popularity of generative AI tools among engineering students in China as of
November 2024
5.1.2 Frequency of using generative AI
Generative AI has become a frequent tool in the academic routines of many engineering
students in China, with 20.95% using it daily or 41.89% using it multiple times per week, as
illustrated in Figure 2(a). Only 4.73% of respondents reported never using generative AI. Figure
2(c) suggests that the frequency of use was higher among postgraduate students (40% reporting
regular use) compared to undergraduates (only 25.64%), likely due to the greater complexity
of postgraduate-level tasks such as research, which require more advanced tool support.
Additionally, our survey results also reveal that students in computer-related disciplines used
generative AI more frequently, reflecting their stronger technical alignment with the tools and
a deeper understanding of AI technologies.
5.1.3 Application scenarios of generative AI
Figure 2(d) illustrate that generative AI has been widely used in various academic tasks by
Chinese engineering students. The most common application was "finding learning resources
or concept explanations" (55.41%), indicating that many students have turned to AI for help
with complex concepts or course materials. Other popular uses include "compiling reports or
documents" (54.73%) and "data analysis" (52.03%), reflecting the tool’s role in enhancing
academic writing and data processing. The frequency of use stated in Section 5.1.2 and the
application scenarios suggest the overwhelming majority of respondents have used generative
AI for tasks related to their majors, such as solving engineering problems, optimizing design
plans, or writing research reports.

Frequency of use for general purposes, (b) Frequency of use for basic academic tasks, (c)
Frequency of general use by postgraduates and undergraduates, (d) Typical adopted application
scenarios.
When it comes to using generative AI for assignments, 32.43% of students used it frequently,
and 41.22% used it occasionally, as shown in Figure 2(b). This indicates that generative AI has
become a regular part of their academic workflows. Despite most surveyed students viewed AI
as an important aid in their academic work, a minority (18.92% rarely and 7.43% never) were
less inclined to use it, possibly due to doubts about its effectiveness or ethical concerns.
In terms of basic application scenarios of generative AI for engineering disciplines, as
illustrated in Figure 2(b), 50.68% of respondents have often adopted AI tools for searching
literature and assisting literature review, while 47.97% of the respondents turned to generative
AI for generating initial ideas for their design assignment or research projects. These highlight
the tool’s role in supporting both academic work and creative thinking.
5.2 The impact of generative AI on Chinese engineering students' learning
5.2.1 Impact on learning efficiency
As shown in Figure 3(a), the survey data reveals that 36.49% and 52.03% reported "significant
improvement" and "improved", respectively, totaling 88.52% of respondents felt their learning
efficiency had been improved by generative AI tools. Only 10.81% noted "almost no change,"
8

and a very small fraction (0.68%) felt that AI use had "reduced" or "significantly reduced"
efficiency. These results indicate a strong consensus on the positive impact of AI on learning
efficiency. These results provide additional support for previous studies (e.g., [40], [55])
highlighting that immediate feedback enables learners to recognize gaps in their understanding
and proactively adapt their strategies to enhance learning efficiency. The rapid content
generation, instant feedback, and extensive knowledge support offered by AI tools significantly
reduced the time traditionally spent on learning and writing tasks, making them particularly
valuable for time-sensitive academic activities like literature search, report writing and data
analysis.
5.2.2 Impact on active learning
The questionnaire results show that generative AI tools had a significant positive impact on the
active learning of Chinese engineering students. 64.19% of participants reported improved
learning initiative, with 41.22% stating it had "improved" and 22.97% saying it had
"significantly improved", as illustrated in Figure 3(a). This highlights that most students viewed
generative AI as a valuable tool to boost motivation and engagement. However, 6.76% reported
a decline in learning initiative, suggesting that AI could be detrimental for students with certain
learning habits, such as over-reliance on the tool that may weaken critical thinking and active
learning.
According to self-determination theory [12], frequent use of AI to complete learning tasks can
undermine students' sense of autonomy and competence, weakening their intrinsic motivation
to learn. This effect is further supported by the Overjustification Effect [56], which suggests
that when intrinsically motivated activities are replaced by heavy reliance on external tools,
individuals may lose interest in the activity itself. In this context, students who were once
engaged in learning may begin to view generative AI merely as a means to quickly finish tasks,
shifting their focus from genuine learning to mere task completion, and diminishing their
interest and initiative over time. This emphasizes the need for caution when integrating
generative AI into inclusive education. Clear usage guidelines should be established,
positioning AI as a learning aid rather than a sole crutch, and educators should monitor its
impact, especially on students with low engagement.
5.2.3 Impact on independent thinking
While generative AI tools have been widely regarded as efficiency boosters for learning, their
impact on independent thinking shows a more complex pattern, as shown in Figure 3(a). About
34.46% of respondents felt that AI had "almost no change" on their ability to think
independently, while 47.97% reported an "improvement" (23.65%) or "significant
improvement (24.32)". This suggests that nearly half of the students viewed generative AI as a
tool that enhances independent thinking by providing new perspectives, feedback, and access
to additional knowledge. In addition, students typically needed to judge the accuracy of the AI
generated content, which might further cultivate their independent thinking. However, 14.86%
and 2.70% of respondents felt that AI had weakened or significantly weakened their ability to
think independently. This reflects the potential downsides of over-reliance on AI, where
students might bypass deep engagement with problems, opting instead for AI-generated
solutions. Our findings further reinforce existing research, especially the studies by Zhai et al.
[57] and Klingbeil et al. [58], which showed that when the reliability of generative AI advice
is hard to assess, individuals are more inclined to trust it uncritically to avoid cognitive effort.
In complex fields like engineering, this may result in a reduction of students' problem-solving
skills and a lack of understanding of the underlying concepts.

9

Figure 3. Impact of generative AI on Chinese engineering students' learning: (a) Impact on
learning efficiency, initiative, independent thinking and creativity, (b) Impact on academic
performance
5.2.4 Impact on creativity
When examining the impact of generative AI on creativity, the survey data show a similar
pattern like AI’s impact on independent thinking, as depicted in Figure 3(a). While 58.78% of
respondents felt that AI had a positive effect on their creativity, with 35.81% noting an
"improvement" and 22.97% a "significant improvement", a sizable portion (29.73%) reported
"almost no change". This group likely used AI for more practical tasks, such as executing
predefined solutions, rather than for creative inspiration. On the other hand, 11.48% of
respondents believed AI had a negative impact on creativity, with 8.78% reporting a "reduction"
and 2.7% a "significant reduction." These results suggest that while generative AI is widely
seen as a powerful tool for generating ideas and solving complex problems, its ability to foster
genuine innovation may be limited for some users, particularly if the generated content is too
formulaic or restricts creative freedom. This can be explained through the theory of multiple
intelligences [51]. Generative AI can mobilize multiple forms of intelligence, such as natural
language understanding, human-like reasoning, and visual content, thereby improving one’s
creativity. However, differences in the intelligence structure of different individuals may lead
to divergent effects of technology on creativity. However, differences in individuals'
intelligence areas may result in varying effects of technology on creativity. If generative AI
does not stimulate the intelligence areas that users rely on, they may feel that their creativity is
limited.
5.2.5 Impact on academic performance
From Figure 3(b), It is notable that nearly half of the respondents did not feel that using
generative AI had improved their academic performance, even though most reported enhanced
learning efficiency and more active learning. This discrepancy can likely be attributed to the
limited specialization of generative AI for specific engineering disciplines and concerns over
the accuracy of generated content, as discussed in Section 5.3. It’s important to recognize that
perception doesn’t always align with actual outcomes [59]. While generative AI often helps
students complete tasks more quickly and smoothly, this can lead to a sense of "higher
efficiency" by students. However, task completion doesn’t necessarily indicate true
understanding, and the satisfaction of finishing a task can mask the real extent of genuine
knowledge learning. Over time, this immediate sense of accomplishment may create the illusion
of "I have learned it," which can diminish students’ continuous engagement in the learning
process. These factors necessitate students' academic judgment in evaluating the relevance and
accuracy of AI-generated materials. When paired with the strengths of generative AI, such
judgment has significant potential to enhance academic performance, as reflected by 12.2% and
10

36.5% of respondents who reported "improved" or "slightly improved" academic outcomes,
respectively.
5.3 Challenges faced by Chinese engineering students in using generative AI
5.3.1 Key challenges in using generative AI
Generative AI has significantly impacted learning efficiency and creativity, but its use in
education presents several challenges. Key issues identified by engineering students include the
accuracy of AI-generated content, over-reliance on AI tools, and technical difficulties, as shown
in Figure 4.
The most prominent challenge, reported by 62.16% of respondents, was the inaccuracy of
generated content. This lack of accuracy undermined students' confidence in using AI outputs,
particularly for tasks involving complex data analysis. Despite AI's potential, there was still
considerable room for improvement in content accuracy, especially tailored to specific
engineering disciplines. This finding is consistent with existing theories suggesting that
frequent exposure to inaccurate outputs, such as those from generative AI tools, can lead to
“negative reinforcement,” ultimately decreasing students' willingness to use these tools [40].
Moreover, the inaccuracy of automated feedback systems limits their ability to effectively
support students in addressing more complex issues, such as developing critical thinking skills
[43, 44]. As shown in Figure 5(a), when asked about the frequency of encountering inaccurate
AI-generated content, 43.24% of respondents reported facing this issue often or very often,
while 37% experienced it occasionally, highlighting the gap between students' needs and AIgenerated content.
The second major concern, cited by 39.86% of respondents, was over-reliance on AI tools.
Many students worried that excessive dependence on these tools might reduce their ability to
solve problems independently and effectively.
Furthermore, 20.27% of respondents reported difficulties with the usability of AI tools, noting
that the user interface can be difficult for beginners and that there was insufficient technical
support, especially for the newly emerged AI tools. As indicated by the pedagogical theory
TAM [49], when users, especially beginners, struggle with system navigation or functions, they
are more likely to experience operational frustration, leading to reduced behavioral intention.
Ethical concerns and privacy issues were raised by 14.19% of respondents, indicating continued
unease about data protection and academic integrity. Additionally, 17.57% of students
mentioned high costs as a barrier to accessing AI tools, which could limit their widespread use.
While generative AI offers clear advantages in education, the need for improvements in
accuracy, usability, and cost is evident. These findings highlight areas for future development,
with tool developers and educational institutions needing to focus on enhancing technical
reliability, simplifying user interfaces, improving support systems, and reducing costs to make
AI tools more accessible.

encountering inaccurate generated responses, (b) Adaptability and specialization of generative
AI for meeting students’ needs, (c) Ethics of using generative AI, (d) Data privacy associated
with generative AI

12

5.3.2 Adaptability and specialization in engineering education
Despite rapid advancements in generative AI, its application in engineering education is
constrained by the discipline's complexity and specialization. Mixed responses were received
in our survey, as shown in Figure 5(b). The survey results showed that 42.57% of respondents
"agree" generative AI tools were suitable for their professional needs, while 18.24% finding
them "strongly agree" on their adopted AI tools.
However, nearly 40% of the respondents expressed concerns about the tools’ effectiveness in
addressing highly specialized problems. Specifically, 28.38% were "neutral" about AI’s
adaptability, and 16.81% deemed them "disagree" or "strongly disagree", suggesting concerns
about AI's specialization towards specific engineering disciplines. These findings are consistent
with prior research showing that when generative AI tools fail to recognize the knowledge
structure, contextual logic, or deep conceptual relationships within a professional domain, they
struggle to effectively support students in constructing meaningful knowledge [43, 44].
5.3.3 Ethical concerns and data privacy in generative AI use
Ethical issues surrounding the use of generative AI, especially in academic assignments, were
another significant concern. Figure 5(c) revealed that 35.14% and 22.97% of respondents
considered ethical issues "important" or "very important", respectively. However, 40.54% of
respondents rated ethical issues as "average importance" and only 1.36% dismissed the
importance of ethics. These findings suggest that ethical concerns regarding generative AI in
education are widely acknowledged and should be addressed through regulation and guidance.
Meanwhile, training on ethics is required for a broader recognition of various ethical issues.
Regarding data privacy, as shown in Figure 5(d), most respondents rated AI tools’ performance
as "average satisfaction" (54.05%), suggesting their lack of confidence in AI tools’ privacy
protection. In addition, 5.41% were "dissatisfied" and 2.7% were "very dissatisfied" with the
data privacy, reflecting room for improvement in data privacy protection. Only 25% of the
respondents found them "satisfied" and 12.84% "very satisfied" with data privacy,
comparatively lower than their agreement on AI’s effectiveness in aiding their learning.
Concerns about privacy violations or ethical issues can discourage users from engaging with
generative AI, even if the technology is perceived as useful [39]. These findings highlight the
urgent need to provide relevant training to students on secure practices when using generative
AI.
5.4 Expectation on generative AI use from Chinese engineering students
5.4.1 Attitudes towards generative AI integration into engineering education
Regarding the integration of generative AI into engineering education, as shown in Figure 6(a),
20.95% supported full integration into teaching, while 43.92% favored a partial integration that
applies only to certain courses or scenarios. Additionally, 30.41% saw AI as a helpful tool, but
not a necessity. Survey results show strong support for integrating generative AI into education.
A large majority of respondents believed that generative AI courses should be compulsory for
engineering students, indicating widespread recognition of its importance and value in
engineering education.
Figure 6(b) shows mixed opinions on whether generative AI can replace traditional teaching
models. 41.89% of respondents were "uncertain", while 12.84% thought it would "probably
not" replace traditional methods. However, 12.84% believed that generative AI will eventually
replace conventional teaching methods, while 30.41% supported this trend with some
reservation. It appears that the overall support for complete replacement was not strong, likely
13

due to technical limitations and ethical concerns surrounding generative AI. This finding
indicates that the development and adoption of technology are not isolated processes but are
deeply embedded within specific social contexts and norms. As previous studies [23, 24, 25]
have reported, technology adoption is influenced by a range of factors, including learning
motivation, educational culture, and prevailing social norms.
In terms of AI-related training offerings, Figure 7(a) 43.24% and 49.32% of respondents
expected institutions to provide basic introductory AI courses and in-depth practical training
on the use of generative AI, respectively. Nearly half of respondents preferred online training
courses.

Figure 7. Institution supports on generative AI use: (a) Favored types of training by Chinese
engineering students, (b) Types of regulations of AI use
14

Respondents also suggested several ways to regulate the use of generative AI, as shown in
Figure 7(b). 55.41% believed that clear usage guidelines should be developed by universities,
while 47.3% favored creating tailored policies based on the specific needs of each curriculum.
46.62% thought training on generative AI should be provided to both students and faculty.
Interestingly, 10.14% supported a complete ban on generative AI use, highlight the concerns
on the adoption of AI for academic purposes from a small group of students. Overall, the survey
results suggest that most respondents prefer regulation and training over prohibition.
5.4.2 Recommendations for educators and institutions
As illustrated in Figure 8(a), most respondents were optimistic about the future of generative
AI in education, with 29.05% and 39.86% describing its potential as "broad" or "very broad",
respectively. However, 27.7% expressed a neutral stance, likely due to the current challenges
and ethical concerns surrounding generative AI in engineering education. Only 3.38% held
negative views, describing its prospects as "narrow" or "very narrow".
Respondents highlighted several areas for improvement in generative AI tools, as illustrated in
Figure 8(b). Over 60% emphasized the need for higher accuracy in addressing disciplinespecific problems, improved literature search capabilities, and integration with professional
software, reflecting the higher academic and professional demands of engineering students.
54.73% expressed a desire for AI tools that can provide deeper insights into professional
questions. There was also interest in enhancing AI's data-processing abilities, with 40.54%
calling for improvements in this area.
Moving forward, schools and education policymakers should develop clear guidelines for the
use of generative AI, design personalized integration plans tailored to different disciplines and
curricula, and as well as provide comprehensive training programs covering technical operation,
practical applications, and ethical issues.

6. Discussion
6.1 Implications for theory
The use of generative AI among engineering students is expanding, with tools like ChatGPT
leading the way due to their broad functionality and ease of use. From the perspective of the
pedagogical theory TAM [49], generative AI is popular precisely because they provide
powerful multimodal information generation and human language understanding capabilities
15

that satisfy perceived usefulness, while highly user-friendly interaction design satisfies
perceived ease of use, thereby reducing students' cognitive load in the technology adoption
process, and improving acceptance of new technologies [49,50]. While postgraduate students
used AI more frequently, the majority of students across all fields and all levels have relied on
AI for tasks like academic writing, data analysis, and concept clarification. However, a smaller
number of students remained hesitant or skeptical about the technology, suggesting a need for
clearer guidance from educators on its proper use.
This study highlights that the generative AI has significantly enhanced learning efficiency and
active learning of engineering students in China through the advantages of instant feedback and
rapid content generation, and meanwhile improved the creativity and independent thinking of
certain students. Reinforcement theory [40] points out that external rewards and punishments
can effectively regulate learners' behavior [60]. External immediate feedback has a good effect
in improving learning efficiency [55], and students' attention and creativity [61]. Unlike
textbooks, which students generally assume to be accurate, AI-generated content can
sometimes be incorrect, which encourages students to evaluate its accuracy when appropriately
used. This can also cultivate independent thinking through the process of reflection and active
construction of knowledge, which aligns well with the constructivist learning theory [45, 46]
that emphasize active learning rather than passive reception of information. According to our
survey, most surveyed students feel their independent thinking was improved or at least not
affected.
When used irresponsibly, AI tools could lead to potential over-reliance and diminish students'
ability to think independently, as suggested by a reasonable portion (17.56%) of respondents
who expressed concerns about its decline. This behavior is driven by the immediate "reward"
brought by AI feedback [40]. Every time a quick answer is obtained through AI, it positively
reinforces students' tendency to avoid thinking and rely on external tools, thereby weakening
their intrinsic motivation for independent thinking. Recent research has also confirmed this,
reporting that this often occurs when individuals have difficulty assessing the reliability of the
AI or how much to trust its recommendations [57, 58]. As such, while AI tools enhance learning
in many ways, students must balance their use with active engagement in problem-solving and
independent thought to fully benefit from their educational experience.
6.2 Implications for practice
Generative AI holds great promise for enhancing engineering education, but its application
faces several challenges, including content accuracy, over-reliance on AI tools, and concerns
about data privacy and ethics. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed students expressed their concern
about the lack of accuracy of AI generated content, a critical issue in engineering where
accuracy is essential. Inaccurate AI responses can mislead students, leading to errors in
practical applications. Therefore, ensuring that AI-generated content is reliable and easily
cross-verified is essential for its integration into engineering education.
Ethical concerns about generative AI in academic settings were highlighted, with 58.11% of
respondents considering them "important" or "very important," though 40.54% viewed them as
of "average importance." This underscores the need for regulation and ethics training to address
these concerns. Data privacy also emerged as a significant issue, with 54.05% rating AI tools’
privacy protection as "average" and only 37.84% expressing satisfaction, revealing a lack of
confidence and room for improvement in this area. Addressing these challenges requires
ongoing improvements in AI tool development, better user support, and more robust privacy
protection. Furthermore, ethical guidelines should be established to ensure that AI tools are
used responsibly and effectively in educational contexts.

16

Respondents identified key areas for improvement in generative AI tools, including better
accuracy in discipline-specific problems, enhanced literature search, integration with
professional software, and stronger data-processing capabilities. Engineering students also
expressed a desire for AI to provide deeper insights into professional questions. To foster
innovative growth in engineering education, schools should establish clear guidelines, create
tailored integration plans, and offer comprehensive training on technical, practical, and ethical
aspects of generative AI.
6.3 Limitations and future research
While this study provides valuable insights, it has several limitations. The reliance on selfreported data introduces potential biases, as students may exaggerate or downplay their use of
AI tools [59]. Students may overestimate their learning with generative AI, perceiving progress
despite little actual improvement [59]. This lack of accurate feedback can reduce motivation
and engagement, ultimately hindering long-term learning depth. To reduce any potential
subjective bias caused by self-reported data and the gap between perceived and actual learning
outcomes, future studies can consider introducing multiple data sources for cross-validation,
including but not limited to objective data such as students' test scores and homework scores,
evaluation data from teachers or peers, and platform log data.
This study does not examine the long-term, evolving impact of generative AI on students’
learning and performance. However, integrating AI technologies into students’ learning
activities and broadly higher education is inherently a gradual process, and short-term research
may fail to capture their full influence on learning trajectories, core competency development,
and career readiness. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of generative AI’s role in
engineering education, future research should adopt longitudinal approaches that track how AI
integration affects skill development, academic outcomes, and professional preparedness over
time.
The characteristics of participants’ background may have important influences on the way they
use generative AI tools. Regionally, students from areas with stronger educational resources
are more open to adopting new technologies. The sample in this study may not be fully
representative of all engineering students, particularly those from institutions with limited
resources or slower technology adoption. In terms of disciplines, those in computer-related
fields typically have greater technical skills and critical awareness, leading to more proactive
AI use, while students in traditional engineering tend to use AI for specific tasks. Postgraduates
are more inclined to apply AI tools to advanced academic work. Future research could explore
these background factors in greater detail to better understand AI’s impact on education.
Additionally, future research can explore how AI can be tailored to the unique needs of different
engineering disciplines. Furthermore, incorporating international survey data could expand the
sample size and shed light on how cultural differences influence generative AI usage among
engineering students.
Ethical and privacy concerns will continue to be a major area of study focus. Establishing robust
ethical frameworks and policies is essential to protect students' rights and ensure that AI tools
are used in a manner that aligns with educational values.
While the sampling strategy used in this study is appropriate and sufficient for its primary goal,
the strategy could be enhanced through complementary methodologies to enable a more finegrained and robust investigation. For greater representativeness, stratified random sampling
could be employed to ensure proportional inclusion of students across different institution tiers
and disciplines, though this would require more extensive coordination. Longitudinal study
designs would allow researchers to capture the evolving nature of AI adoption over time. In
addition, incorporating behavioral data analytics, such as AI platform usage metrics, could
17

provide objective validation of self-reported behaviors and help reduce potential social
desirability bias. A mixed-method approach, combining quantitative surveys with qualitative
interviews, would offer deeper insights into usage patterns and the motivations behind them.
While these alternatives demand more resources, they would significantly enhance the validity
and generalizability of findings, supporting a more comprehensive and accurate understanding
of how generative AI is shaping engineering education.
7. Conclusion
This study explores the use of generative AI among engineering students in China, examining
its potential and challenges in engineering education through a questionnaire survey. The data
and findings in this study offer valuable insights that can inform and support the developments
of pedagogical theories.
The results indicate that a majority of students were already using generative AI in their
academic and daily learning activities. The survey shows that generative AI has positively
impacted learning efficiency, with 88.52% of respondents reporting improved productivity
through faster content generation and feedback. 64.19% of participants experienced increased
learning initiative, though 6.76% felt over-reliance negatively affected their motivation. Nearly
48% believed AI enhanced independent thinking, offering new perspectives, while a small
minority felt it weakened their critical thinking. AI also boosted creativity for 58.78% of
respondents, though 29.73% saw no change, and 11.48% felt it stifled creativity due to
formulaic content. Nearly half of the respondents felt that using generative AI did not improve
their academic performance, despite most acknowledging increased learning efficiency and
greater engagement in active learning.
Generative AI in education presents several challenges, particularly in engineering, with
students highlighting issues such as the inaccuracy of AI-generated content (62.16%), overreliance on AI tools (39.86%), and technical difficulties with usability (20.27%). The
inaccuracy of AI outputs, especially for complex tasks, undermines student confidence, while
concerns about over-dependence may hinder independent problem-solving skills. Ethical
concerns, privacy issues, and high costs were also identified as barriers to AI tool adoption.
Additionally, while 42.57% of students found AI tools suitable for their needs, nearly 40%
expressed doubts about AI’s ability to handle specialized engineering problems, indicating a
need for more adaptable and specialized AI solutions in the field.
The survey indicates strong optimism about the future of generative AI in education, with most
respondents viewing its potential as broad, though 27.7% remained neutral due to challenges
and ethical concerns. Regarding its integration into engineering education, 20.95% supported
full integration, while 43.92% favored partial integration, with many believing generative AI
courses should be compulsory.
For regulation, 55.41% favored clear usage guidelines, and 47.3% supported tailored policies
based on curriculum needs, with 46.62% advocating for training for both students and faculty.
Opinions on whether AI could replace traditional teaching methods were mixed, with 41.89%
uncertain and 12.84% supporting the idea, though concerns over technical and ethical issues
limited strong support. Respondents also emphasized the need for AI tools to improve accuracy,
literature search capabilities, and integration with professional software. To move forward,
educational institutions should focus on clear guidelines, customized integration plans, and
comprehensive training programs covering technical, practical, and ethical aspects of
generative AI.
