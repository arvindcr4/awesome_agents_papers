**TITLE:** IMPALA: Scalable Distributed Deep-RL with Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architectures
**ARXIV_ID:** 1802.01561v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** IMPALA is a scalable distributed deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses an actor-learner architecture to learn policies in parallel. It introduces a novel off-policy correction method called V-trace, which allows for efficient learning from trajectories generated by different policies.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduced the IMPALA algorithm, which enables scalable distributed deep reinforcement learning
* Developed the V-trace off-policy correction method, which improves the stability and efficiency of learning from trajectories generated by different policies
* Demonstrated the effectiveness of IMPALA on a range of tasks, including DMLab-30 and Atari-57
* Showed that IMPALA can achieve better performance than A3C and other algorithms on certain tasks, while also being more data-efficient and robust to hyperparameter choices.
