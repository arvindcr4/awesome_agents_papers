**PAPER:** Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Large Neighborhoods Search
**TITLE:** MARL-LNS
**ARXIV_ID:** 2404.03101v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a new learning framework called MARL-LNS, which reduces the time used in the training process of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) without harming the performance of the final converged policy. The framework trains on alternating subsets of agents using existing deep MARL algorithms as low-level trainers, without introducing any additional parameters to be trained.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a new learning framework called MARL-LNS for cooperative MARL
* Provides three algorithm variants: random large neighborhood search (RLNS), batch large neighborhood search (BLNS), and adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS)
* Demonstrates that MARL-LNS can reduce training time by at least 10% while reaching the same final skill level as the original algorithm
* Evaluates the algorithms on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research Football environments
