**TITLE:** Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2508.06836v1 [cs.AI]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a new method for addressing the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The method, called Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), uses a multi-level formulation to model the credit assignment in multi-agent cooperation. MACA constructs three different counterfactual advantage functions to infer contributions from individual actions, joint actions, and actions taken by strongly correlated partners. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture to capture agents' correlations via the attention mechanism.
