**PAPER:** Automatic Goal Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents
**TITLE:** Automatic Goal Generation for Reinforcement Learning Agents
**ARXIV_ID:** 1705.06366v5
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a method for automatic goal generation in reinforcement learning, which uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate goals that are at the appropriate level of difficulty for the current policy. The GAN is trained to produce goals that are within the set of goals of intermediate difficulty (GOID), which is defined as the set of goals for which the current policy obtains an intermediate level of return.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper proposes a novel method for automatic goal generation in reinforcement learning, which uses a GAN to generate goals that are at the appropriate level of difficulty for the current policy.
* The method is shown to be effective in several environments, including a quadruped robot navigation task and a point-mass maze task.
* The paper provides a detailed analysis of the method, including a study of the hyperparameters and a comparison with other methods.
* The method is shown to be able to handle sparse rewards and to generate goals that are within the feasible region of the environment.
* The paper provides a detailed description of the implementation, including the architecture of the GAN and the policy, and the training procedure.
