Abstract Snippet:
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS: SYSTEMS  1  Recursive Least Squares Advantage Actor-Critic Algorithms  arXiv:2201.05918v2 [cs.LG] 14 Feb 2022  Yuan Wang, Chunyuan Zhang, Tianzong Yu, Meng Ma  Abstract—As an important algorithm in deep reinforcement learning, advantage actor critic (A2C) has been widely succeeded in both discrete and continuous control tasks with raw pixel inputs, but its sample efficiency still needs to improve more. In traditional reinforcement learning, actor-critic algorithms generally use the recursive least squares (RLS) technology to update the parame...
