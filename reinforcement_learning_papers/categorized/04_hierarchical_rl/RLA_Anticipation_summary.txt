**TITLE:** Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation: A Hierarchical Approach for Long-Horizon Tasks
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 04_hierarchical_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces a new framework called Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), which is a hierarchical approach to solve long-horizon tasks. RLA decomposes the agent into two synergistic components: a low-level policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The anticipation model is trained using a principled approach, guided by a principle of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of the RLA framework, which addresses the challenges of long-horizon tasks in reinforcement learning.
* Development of a principled method for training a high-level anticipation model, which provides a dense and stable learning signal.
* Provision of theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the RLA system to a globally optimal policy under standard conditions.
* Empirical evaluation of the RLA framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving long-horizon tasks.
* Discussion of the potential applications and extensions of the RLA framework, including its use in more complex, high-dimensional environments.
