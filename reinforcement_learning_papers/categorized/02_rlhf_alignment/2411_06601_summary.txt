TITLE: OffLight: An Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Traffic Signal Control
ARXIV_ID: 2411.06601v3
RESEARCH_METHOD: 02_rlhf_alignment

METHOD_DESCRIPTION: OffLight is an offline multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in traffic signal control datasets. It integrates importance sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and return-based prioritized sampling (RBPS) to emphasize high-quality experiences. OffLight uses a Gaussian mixture model variational graph autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to represent diverse behavior policies accurately.

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* OffLight effectively handles heterogeneous behavior policies in offline datasets, outperforming existing offline RL methods.
* The framework reduces average travel time by up to 7.8% and queue length by 11.2% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
* OffLight scales well across diverse network sizes, from small to large-scale urban environments.
* The framework is applicable to other domains, such as smart grids and supply chain management, where offline MARL can optimize decision-making in networked systems.
