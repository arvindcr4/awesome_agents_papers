R EINFORCEMENT L EARNING WITH A NTICIPATION : A H IERARCHICAL A PPROACH FOR L ONG -H ORIZON TASKS  arXiv:2509.05545v1 [cs.LG] 6 Sep 2025  A P REPRINT Yang Yu National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University, China yuy@nju.edu.cn  A BSTRACT Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joi...
