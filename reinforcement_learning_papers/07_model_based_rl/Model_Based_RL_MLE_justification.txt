Abstract Snippet:
Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Action Spaces  Renhao Zhang * 1 Haotian Fu * 1 Yilin Miao 1 George Konidaris 1  arXiv:2404.03037v3 [cs.LG] 24 May 2024  Abstract  or Robot Soccer (Hausknecht & Stone, 2016b).  We propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm—Dynamics Learning and predictive control with Parameterized Actions (DLPA)—for Parameterized Action Markov Decision Processes (PAMDPs). The agent learns a parameterized-action-conditioned dynamics model and plans with a modified Model Predictive Path Integral control. We theoretically quantify the differen...
