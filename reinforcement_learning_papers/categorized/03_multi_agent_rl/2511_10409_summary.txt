TITLE: Explaining Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Policies
ARXIV_ID: 2511.10409v1
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper proposes a method for generating policy summarizations and query-based explanations for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies. The method uses Hasse diagrams to represent the partial order of task completions and introduces an uncertainty dictionary to capture unordered task dependencies. The authors also develop a query-based explanation approach that generates language-based explanations for specific agent behaviors.

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* A method for generating policy summarizations for decentralized MARL policies using Hasse diagrams
* An uncertainty dictionary to capture unordered task dependencies
* A query-based explanation approach for generating language-based explanations for specific agent behaviors
* Evaluation of the method on four MARL domains and two decentralized MARL algorithms
* User studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed policy summarizations and query-based explanations
