Abstract Snippet:
Probabilistic Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning Edwin Hamel-De le Court, Francesco Belardinelli, Alexander W. Goodall  arXiv:2503.07671v3 [stat.ML] 25 Mar 2025  Imperial College London {e.hamel-de-le-court, francesco.belardinelli, a.goodall22}@ic.ac.uk  Abstract In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constrain...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Probabilistic Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning Edwin Hamel-De le Court, Francesco Belardinelli, Alexander W."
- "Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 05_safe_constrained_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as safety, constrained, cpo, matching the research direction's core themes.
