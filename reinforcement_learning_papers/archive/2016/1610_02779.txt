The complex-source-point model are already used in the exact solution for the
urtrashort pulse and nonparaxial beam. In this letter we have used the
complex-source-point model to deduce the interaction potential equation for the
separation R between two atoms which is comparable with the size of the atoms. We
show the result and the characteristics of the numerical calculation. Since the singular
point around R=0 is removed by using the complex-source-point model, so that we
can obtain the result force around R=0. With the decreasing of the distance between
two atoms, the force switches from the electromagnetic force to the strong force by
use our equation.

I. INTRODUCTION
In 1948, the famous Dutch physicist H.B.G. Casimir predicted the existence of a
force between two conducting plates [1]. The same year, Casimir together with Polder
predicted the analogous attractive force between two atoms (or molecules) [2]. The
Casimir-Polder (CP) force arises from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic
field. For atoms having a dominant transition with frequency

between the ground

and first excited states, they showed that the interaction between the two atoms
reduced to the London limit of the van der Waals interaction in the near zone, i.e.,
dependence for small separations (
decays like

in the far zone [2].

). In contrast, the interaction energy

On the experimental side, CP forces measurements at distances ranging from 10-8
m to 10-3 m have been the domain of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and
of torsion balance experiments [3-5]. Over the last decade, a number of proposals and
experiments that explore CP interactions at very short range using the metrological
advantages of cold atoms and Bose Einstein condensates (BEC). For instance, atoms
reflecting from evanescent waves near surfaces [6], atoms transmitted through a
cavity made of two gold coated plates [7], atoms diffracted from a material grating [8],
atoms undergoing quantum reflection [9], the frequency shift of the collective
oscillations of a magnetically trapped BEC [10, 11], BEC vibrations by using
micromechanical cantilever [12], Bloch oscillations [13], atom interference phase
difference [14] and atomic clock shift [15], etc. Since the cold atoms has less moving
velocity and even can be almost stopped at one position, so that the separation
between two atoms can be adjusted much shorter than the traditional mechanical
system. A natural question along that line is what will happen when the separation
between two atoms is comparable with the size of the atoms. This what we are going
to investigate the atomic size zone Casimir-Polder potential between two ground-state
atoms.
There are lots of methods aimed at obtaining the CP potential, for example, the
perturbation theory based on two-transverse-photon exchange [16,17], the use of the
multipolar framework include response theory [18], consideration of the changes in
zero-point energy[19], radiative reaction[20], evaluation of energy shifts in the
Heisenberg picture[21], the method based on spatial vacuum field correlations[22-24],
source theory[18] and so on. For the calculation of van der Waals forces between
nanoparticles whose size and separation are comparable, traditional procedures via
summing over infinitesimal elements, such as Hamaker’s method[25] and the
proximity force approximation[26], have been widely used. However, van der Waals
forces are inherently nonadditive interactions. Recently, Zhao et al. study the van der
Waals forces between two spheres and between a sphere and a plane with arbitrary
separation using transformation optics [27].

Our calculation of the interaction potential between two atoms is based upon the
method of equal-time spatial vacuum field correlations [22-24], which can simplify
some calculations in some complex external environment. The main idea based on the
vacuum spatial correlations can be explained as that the vacuum fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field induce instantaneous correlated dipole moments on the two
atoms, and the interaction potential energy can be obtained by calculating the classical
interaction between the two correlated induced dipoles [22-24].
II. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD OF THE INDUCED DIPOLE
Let us assume a pair of electric dipoles in vacuum. The negative charge
fixed at the origin of the coordinates, while the positive charge

is
The

electromagnetic field of the induced dipole is located along the x axis and is
oscillating with time. Thus the time-varying electric dipole moment can be written as
p  t   ql  t  ex , where l(t) is the distance between the negative and positive charges and
ex is the unit vector along the x axis. Under the Lorentz condition, using the relations

between the electromagnetic field and the potential function, we can derive the
expression for the electric dipole radiation field as the following [28]:

Where R  x 2  y 2  z 2 is the distance from the origin to the observation point,
c is the velocity of light in vacuum, the time factor of the physical quantities written
in shortened form with brackets indicates the retarded time (t-R/c),  p  and  p 
represent the first and second order partial derivatives of the electrical dipole moment
p with respect to the retarded time respectively.

In order to compare the expression with the others [22-24], we modify the
electric field expression as the following:

Where k is the oscillating frequency of the dipole, and k  k / c is the wave
number. Rˆi  Ri / R denotes the ith element of the unit displacement vector of R / R .
Assuming there are two atoms A and B fixed at the certain locations in
space-time. The distance between two atom’s center is R  2r0   , where r0 is the
radius of the atom and  is the separation of two atom’s edge. The potential energy
then can be considered as the interaction between the two correlated induced dipoles
according to the spatially correlated vacuum fluctuations. Therefore, the interaction
potential of two ground-state atoms reads [22-24]

Where the term coth  hk / 2kT  is called as the temperature factor.  A, B k  is the

Where 0 is the transition frequency from the ground sate to the excited state and

 is the matrix element of the atomic dipole momentum operator. There are one
special example needed to discuss, for cold atoms kT  0 , then coth(hk / 2kT )  1 .
Substituting Eq.(4) into Eq.(5), the interaction potential of two cold atoms becomes

where u  ik . We know that there is a singular point at R=0 in Eq. (8). Usually, the
distance between atoms R is much larger than the atom size. But with the lower of the
atom temperature, the distance between atoms can be comparable with the atom size.
So it is important to analyze the interaction potential of two atoms for R close to zero.
III. THE NUMERICAL CALCULATION OF THE INTERACTION
POTENTIAL
In order to remove the singular point, we use the complex-source-point model, which
was first introduced for scalar beams by Deschamps[30]. The basic idea of the
complex-source-point (CSP) model is as follows. As shown in Fig.1, every atom is
composed of the nucleus and the electron cloud. Electrons surround the atomic
nucleus in pathways called orbitals. The inner orbitals surrounding the atom are
spherical but the outer orbitals are much more complicated. Due to the position of the
electron is not fixed, so that the distance between two atoms depends on the position
of dipoles, which is always changed. Thus we can consider the distance between two
atoms as R  R  iR0 according to the complex-source-point model. R is the distance
between two centers of the atom nucleus. R0 is the coordinate value of the source point
on the imaginary axis. The value of the R0 is related to the atom size, and explain the
uncertainty of the position of the electron. By the way, in the complex-source-point
model, the electric dipole radiation fields still satisfy Maxwell’s equation exactly [28].

Fig.1 the basic complex-source-point (CSP) model for interaction potential
between two atoms.
Substituting R' into Eq.(8), considering that the complex-source-point model has
clear physical significance only in the real space, only the real part of the potential is
needed. Now we illustrate the interaction potential in the complex-source-point model
with some numerical calculation. Assume

, μ0 =1 and R0 =10-11m.

Of course, the parameters can be other value, which does not make essential
difference in the result. Fig.2(a)-(c) show the interaction potential versus the R
coordinate in the complex-source-point model. Generally, the interaction potential
approaches to infinite as R is close to zero because of the singular point at R=0, as
shown in Fig. 2(d). But the interaction potential in the complex-source-point model is
different, there is three singular value of the potential nearby R=0. The position of
these three singular points are around at 0.5R0, 1.2R0, 4.2R0 respectively, the three
coefficients depend on the oscillating frequency of the dipole. Here, we should
explain the calculation of the different value of R0. The value of the interaction
potential in the complex-source-point model will be decreased with the increasing of
the value of R0, but the three singular points are still lie around at 0.5R0, 1.2R0, 4.2R0
respectively.
From Fig. 2(a), we can find that when the distance R is smaller than the first
singular value around 0.5R0, the interaction force is strong repulsive force. With the

distance increasing, the interaction force become attractive force. When the distance R
is bigger than 1.2 R0, the interaction between two atoms is repulsive force, until R
colse to 4.2 R0, then force become attractive force again, as shown in Fig. 2(b). This
behavior like the van der Waals force. After the distance increasing to 20R0, the value
of interaction force is almost the same as the general CP force, as shown in Fig.2(c)
and (d).

with R0 =10 . (d) The general CP potential.

As we shown above, when the distance bigger than 1.2R0, the interaction force
behavior as the van der Waals force and CP force, which are the electromagnetic
interaction force. Now, we focuse on the interaction potential for the distance smaller
than 1.2R0. We think this interaction belongs to strong interaction, include the strong
attractive force and the strong pulsive force. The value of strong force is about 104
bigger than the electromagnetic force. When the distance is between 0.5R0 and 1.2R0,
the strong interaction force is attractive, which force overcomes the repulsive van der

Waals force, make the hadrons bound together tightly into the atom nuclear. When the
distance between the two atoms is smaller than 0.5R0, the strong interaction force is
pulsive, which force prevents the two atoms from overlapping together.

IV. CONCLUSION
In this letter we have used the complex-source-point model to study the
interaction potential in the separation between two atoms which is comparable with
the size of the atoms. We show the result and the characteristics of the numerical
calculation. With the increasing of the distance between two atoms, there are four
kinds of force, which corresponding to two strong forces (replusive and attractive)
and two electromagnetic forces (replusive and attractive). The electromagnetic force
is the same behavior like the van der Waals force. So that in this paper, we would like
to say that we might already use one equation to unify two forces: strong force and
electromagnetic force.
