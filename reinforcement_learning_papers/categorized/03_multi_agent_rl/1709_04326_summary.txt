**PAPER:** Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness
**TITLE:** Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness
**ARXIV_ID:** 1709.04326v4
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) is a method in which each agent shapes the anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning rule includes an additional term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. This method enables cooperation in multi-agent settings, such as the iterated prisoners' dilemma and matching pennies games.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* LOLA agents learn to cooperate in the iterated prisoners' dilemma and matching pennies games, while naive learners defect.
* LOLA leads to stable learning of the Nash equilibrium in the matching pennies game.
* LOLA agents achieve the highest average returns in a round-robin tournament against other multi-agent learning algorithms.
* A policy gradient-based version of LOLA is derived, making it applicable to deep RL settings.
* LOLA agents learn to cooperate in a multi-step game, such as the Coin Game, even when the opponent's policy parameters are unknown.
