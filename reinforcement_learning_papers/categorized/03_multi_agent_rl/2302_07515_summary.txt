**TITLE:** TiZero: Mastering Multi-Agent Football with Curriculum Learning and Self-Play
**ARXIV_ID:** 2302.07515v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** TiZero is a multi-agent reinforcement learning system that uses curriculum learning and self-play to master the game of football. The system consists of a joint-policy optimization objective, curriculum self-play, and a challenge & generalize self-play strategy.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* TiZero is the first system to train strong agents for the GFootball 11 vs. 11 game mode from scratch, controlling all 10 outfield players in a decentralized fashion.
* The system uses a novel self-play strategy that improves the diversity and performance of opponent policies.
* TiZero outperforms previous systems by a wide margin in terms of win rate and goal difference.
* The system utilizes complex coordination behaviors more often than prior systems.
* The algorithmic innovations of TiZero are general and can be applied to other multi-agent reinforcement learning environments.
