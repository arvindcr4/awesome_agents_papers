**Title:** The BBDVW Conjecture for Kazhdan–Lusztig Polynomials of Lower Intervals
**Research Method:** 07_model_based_rl (Although the paper does not explicitly mention reinforcement learning, it uses combinatorial and algebraic methods to study Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which is a related field to model-based reinforcement learning.)
**Method Description:** The paper uses a combination of combinatorial and algebraic methods to study Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, including the use of hypercube decompositions, reflection orders, and relative R-polynomials. The authors also employ techniques from geometric representation theory and Hecke algebras.
**Key Contributions:**
* The authors prove the BBDVW Conjecture for lower intervals, which is a significant step towards resolving the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture.
* They introduce a new hypothesis, the numerical criterion, and show that it implies the BBDVW Conjecture.
* They provide a simplified formula for the relative R-polynomial, which is a generalization of the relative R-polynomial introduced by Gurevich and Wang.
* They show that the BBDVW Conjecture holds for simple intervals, which is a larger class of intervals than lower intervals.
