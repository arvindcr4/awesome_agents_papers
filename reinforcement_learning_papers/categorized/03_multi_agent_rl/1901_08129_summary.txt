**PAPER:** MARLÖ: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in MalmÖ
**TITLE:** The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in MalmÖ (MARLÖ) Competition
**ARXIV_ID:** 1901.08129v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The MARLÖ competition proposes a challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning using multiple 3D games in the Minecraft environment. The goal is to foster research in general agents that can learn across different games and opponent types. The competition features three games: Mob Chase, Build Battle, and Treasure Hunt, which are parameterizable to create endless variants.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning using multiple 3D games
* Features three games with different dynamics and challenges for multi-agent RL research
* Provides a shared baseline and evaluation setup for comparison between approaches
* Encourages research in general agents that can learn across different games and opponent types
* Creates a platform for testing and sharing progress in the field of multi-agent RL
