**PAPER**: LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE**: LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID**: 2508.04652v7
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to train large language models (LLMs) to collaborate with each other. The authors model LLM collaboration as a cooperative MARL problem and develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm called Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO) to solve it.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* The authors propose a MARL approach to train LLMs to collaborate with each other.
* They develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm called MAGRPO to solve the LLM collaboration problem.
* They evaluate the performance of MAGRPO on several tasks, including writing and coding collaboration.
* They demonstrate that MAGRPO can enable LLMs to generate high-quality responses through effective cooperation.
* They provide an analysis of the limitations of existing approaches and outline open challenges in applying MARL to LLM collaboration.
