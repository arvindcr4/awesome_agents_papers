**TITLE:** Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving
**ARXIV_ID:** 2501.08096v3 [cs.RO]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action space (HPA-MoEC) for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. HPA-MoEC adopts a MORL architecture focused on AD tasks, with multiple reward functions guiding ensemble-critics to focus on specific driving objectives. The architecture integrates a hybrid parameterized action space structure, containing a discrete action set and its corresponding continuous parameters, to generate driving actions that combine abstract guidance and concrete control commands. Additionally, an uncertainty-based exploration mechanism is developed to enhance learning efficiency.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* A MORL architecture compatible with multiple AD objectives is proposed, with ensemble-critics focusing on distinct objectives using separate reward functions.
* A hybrid parameterized action space structure is designed to combine finer-grained guidance and control commands, adapting to hybrid road modality.
* An epistemic uncertainty-based exploration mechanism is developed to enhance learning efficiency and complement the hybrid action space structure.
* Experimental results demonstrate that HPA-MoEC efficiently learns multi-objective compatible driving behaviors, improving driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety.
