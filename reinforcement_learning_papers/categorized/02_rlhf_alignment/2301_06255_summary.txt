**TITLE:** Stability of PT and anti-PT -symmetric Hamiltonians with different periodicities
**ARXIV_ID:** 2301.06255v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper investigates the stability of PT and anti-PT -symmetric Hamiltonians with different periodicities using Floquet theory. The authors analyze the stability of these systems by determining the regions of stability and instability in the parameter space of the drive frequency and amplitude. They also study the geometric phases acquired during cyclic variations of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
