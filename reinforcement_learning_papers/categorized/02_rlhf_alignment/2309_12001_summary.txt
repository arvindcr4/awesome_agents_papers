**TITLE:** Exploring Human’s Gender Perception and Bias toward Non-Humanoid Robots
**ARXIV_ID:** Not provided
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (RLHF Alignment)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The study investigates human perception of gender and bias toward non-humanoid robots through three surveys. The surveys examine how design elements, such as physical appearance, voice modulation, and behavioral attributes, affect gender perception and task suitability.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The study reveals that humans tend to attribute gender to non-humanoid robots based on their physical and behavioral attributes.
* The results show that gender cues in robot design can influence human perceptions of task performance and comfort.
* The study highlights the importance of considering gender biases in robot design to enhance human-robot interaction.
* The findings suggest that non-humanoid robots can be designed to be more relatable and trustworthy by incorporating anthropomorphic cues, such as voice modulation and behavioral attributes.
* The study contributes to the understanding of human-robot interaction and provides insights for the design of more effective and socially acceptable robots.
