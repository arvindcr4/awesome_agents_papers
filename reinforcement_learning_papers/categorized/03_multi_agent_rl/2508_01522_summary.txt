**TITLE:** Decentralized Aerial Manipulation of a Cable-Suspended Load using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2508.01522v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper presents a decentralized method using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to achieve full-pose control of a cable-suspended load using multiple Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). The method leverages MARL to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV, which generates reference accelerations and body rates for a low-level controller. The policy is trained in a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO).
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The first decentralized method to achieve fully decentralized and onboard-deployed cooperative aerial manipulation in experiments with real MAVs, without any inter-MAV communication.
* A novel action space design for MAVs manipulating a cable-suspended load, together with a robust low-level controller, enabling successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.
* First demonstration of robust full-pose control of the cable-suspended load under heterogeneous conditions and even under complete in-flight failure of an MAV.
