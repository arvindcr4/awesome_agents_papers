**TITLE:** Deep Policy Gradient Methods Without Batch Updates, Target Networks, or Replay Buffers
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel incremental algorithm called Action Value Gradient (AVG) that uses reparameterization gradient estimation and incorporates normalization and scaling techniques to stabilize learning. AVG is designed for deep reinforcement learning with limited computational resources and does not require batch updates, target networks, or replay buffers.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposal of the AVG algorithm for incremental deep reinforcement learning
* Demonstration of AVG's ability to outperform other incremental and resource-constrained batch methods across various benchmark tasks
* Introduction of normalization and scaling techniques to stabilize learning in AVG
* Application of AVG to real-world robot learning tasks, including the UR-Reacher-2 and Create-Mover tasks
* Achievement of robust performance and efficient learning in resource-constrained environments
