Unsupervised Data Generation for Offline Reinforcement Learning: A Perspective from Model Shuncheng He1 , Hongchang Zhang1 , Jianzhun Shao1 , Yuhang Jiang1 , Xiangyang Ji1 1  arXiv:2506.19643v1 [cs.LG] 24 Jun 2025  Tsinghua University hesc16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn  Abstract Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL. Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in in-distribution even in-s...
