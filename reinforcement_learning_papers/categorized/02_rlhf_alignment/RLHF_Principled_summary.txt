**Paper Information**

* Filename: Not provided
* Title: Principled Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback from Pairwise or K-wise Comparisons
* Research Method: 02_rlhf_alignment

**Method Description**

The paper proposes a theoretical framework for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and analyzes the sample complexity of RLHF. The authors consider two types of comparisons: pairwise and K-wise comparisons. They provide guarantees for the estimation error of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the induced policy's sub-optimality.

**Key Contributions**

* The paper provides a theoretical framework for RLHF and analyzes the sample complexity of RLHF.
* The authors show that pessimism is important to guarantee a good policy.
* They provide guarantees for the estimation error of the MLE and the induced policy's sub-optimality for both pairwise and K-wise comparisons.
* The paper also connects RLHF with offline reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning.

**Other Relevant Information**

* The paper assumes that the reward function is linear and parameterized by a known feature function.
* The authors use a Plackett-Luce model to model human behavior in K-wise comparisons.
* The paper provides experimental results to verify the theoretical analysis.
* The authors discuss the implications of their results for algorithm design in RLHF and provide suggestions for future work.
