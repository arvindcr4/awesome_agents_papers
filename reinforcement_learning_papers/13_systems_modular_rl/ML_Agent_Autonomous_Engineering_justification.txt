Abstract Snippet:
ML-Agent: Reinforcing LLM Agents for Autonomous Machine Learning Engineering  arXiv:2505.23723v1 [cs.CL] 29 May 2025  Zexi Liu1 2 * 1  Jingyi Chai1 2 * Xinyu Zhu1 Shuo Tang1 Bo Zhang2 Lei Bai2 † Siheng Chen1 †  Rui Ye1  Shanghai Jiao Tong University 2 Shanghai AI Laboratory * Equal Contribution † Corresponding Author ML-Agent: https://github.com/zeroxleo/ML-Agent  Abstract The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched"

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 14_systems_modular_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as system, distributed, infrastructure, matching the research direction's core themes.
