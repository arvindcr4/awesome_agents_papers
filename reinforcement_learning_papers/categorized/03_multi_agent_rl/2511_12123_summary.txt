**TITLE:** HCPO: Hierarchical Conductor-Based Policy Optimization in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2511.12123v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** HCPO is a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and improves exploration. It uses a conductor-based framework to guide agents' exploration and a two-level policy update mechanism to optimize the joint policy.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Hierarchical conductor-based policy expression to enhance joint policy expressive capacity and guide multi-agent exploration
* HCPO algorithm with a two-level policy update mechanism and monotonic improvement guarantees
* Extensive experimental validation on MARL benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to strong MARL baselines
* Ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of key components of HCPO, including the conductor and KL-divergence constraint.
