**TITLE:** Causal Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Review and Open Problems
**ARXIV_ID:** 2111.06721v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper reviews the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and its intersection with causal methods. The authors argue that causal methods can provide improved safety, interpretability, and robustness in MARL, and discuss potential solutions for common challenges in MARL. They also introduce the concept of a "causality first" perspective on MARL, where causal models are used to guide the learning process.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction to the field of MARL and its challenges
* Discussion of the benefits of using causal methods in MARL, including improved safety, interpretability, and robustness
* Introduction of the "causality first" perspective on MARL, where causal models are used to guide the learning process
* Discussion of potential solutions for common challenges in MARL, including non-stationarity, knowledge sharing, and decentralized reasoning
* Review of related work in causal reinforcement learning, including counterfactual reasoning and causal imitation learning.
