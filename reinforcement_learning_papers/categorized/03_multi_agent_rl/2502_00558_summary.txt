**PAPER:** Asynchronous Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Limited Communication
**TITLE:** AsynCoMARL
**ARXIV_ID:** 2502.00558v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** AsynCoMARL is a graph-transformer communication protocol for asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning. Each agent's graph transformer utilizes a dynamic, weighted, directed graph to learn a communication protocol with other active agents in its vicinity.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* AsynCoMARL achieves similar success and collision rates as leading baselines, despite 26% fewer messages being passed between agents.
* The algorithm is evaluated on two environments: Cooperative Navigation and Rover-Tower, which replicate real-world scenarios with communication constraints.
* AsynCoMARL outperforms other baselines in terms of success rate, collision rate, and communication frequency.
* The graph transformer communication protocol learns to attend to both agents in proximity to the active agent and those agents from whom it gets more frequent communication.
* Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph transformer-based communication protocol and the importance of reward structures in asynchronous settings.
