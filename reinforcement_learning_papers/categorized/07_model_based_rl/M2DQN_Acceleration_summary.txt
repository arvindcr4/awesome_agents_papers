TITLE: Laminar and Turbulence Forced Heat Transfer Convection Correlations Inside Tubes. A Review
RESEARCH_METHOD: 07_model_based_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper presents a comprehensive review of laminar and turbulent forced convection heat transfer correlations inside tubes, covering both experimental and numerical studies. The review focuses on the effects of tube geometry, fluid properties, and flow conditions on heat transfer performance, with a particular emphasis on nanofluids. The authors discuss various correlations for predicting Nusselt numbers, friction factors, and heat transfer coefficients, highlighting the limitations and applicability of each correlation. The review aims to provide a holistic understanding of forced convection heat transfer in tubes, which is essential for optimizing thermal design and performance in various engineering applications.
