Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Tsang23† , Quanquan Gu1† 1 Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles 2 IHPC, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore 3 CFAR, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore {hyzhao,qgu}@cs.ucla.edu {yu xingrui,david bossens,ivor tsang}@cfar.a-star.edu.sg  A BSTRACT Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert’s behavior."
- "In practice, it is often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 08_imitation_learning because it explicitly discusses concepts such as imitation, demonstration, expert, matching the research direction's core themes.
