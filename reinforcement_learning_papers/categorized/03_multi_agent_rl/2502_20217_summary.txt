**TITLE:** MARVEL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for constrained field-of-View multi-robot Exploration in Large-scale environments

**ARXIV_ID:** 2502.20217v1 [cs.RO]

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** MARVEL is a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained field-of-view (FoV) sensors. The approach handles the large action space of viewpoints planning using an information-driven action pruning strategy.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* MARVEL outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent exploration planners in terms of trajectory length, overlap ratio, and success rate.
* The approach adapts well to different team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without requiring retraining.
* MARVEL demonstrates superior stability and generalization across diverse environments.
* The approach has been successfully validated on real drones, demonstrating its potential for deployment on actual robots.
* MARVEL can be extended to handle full 3D action spaces by integrating height information and associated FoV changes, enhancing its application on platforms such as drones for indoor mapping.
