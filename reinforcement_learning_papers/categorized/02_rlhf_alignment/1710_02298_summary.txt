**TITLE:** Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1710.02298v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchical Feedback Alignment)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** Rainbow combines six existing techniques: Double Q-learning, Prioritized Experience Replay, Dueling Networks, Multi-step Learning, Distributional Q-learning, and Noisy Nets. The algorithm integrates these techniques into a single framework, using a combination of convolutional neural networks and dueling network architectures to estimate the expected return and its distribution.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Combines six existing techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 2600 benchmark
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating multiple techniques in a single framework
* Provides a detailed analysis of the contribution of each technique to the overall performance
* Achieves a median human-normalized score of 223% in the no-ops regime and 153% in the human starts regime
