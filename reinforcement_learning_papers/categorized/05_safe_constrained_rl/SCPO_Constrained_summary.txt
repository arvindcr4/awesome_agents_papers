**PAPER:** State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization
**TITLE:** State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 05_safe_constrained_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a new policy search algorithm for state-wise constrained reinforcement learning, called State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization (SCPO). SCPO provides guarantees for state-wise constraint satisfaction at each iteration and allows training of high-dimensional neural network policies while ensuring policy behavior.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* SCPO is the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for state-wise constrained RL.
* SCPO provides guarantees for state-wise constraint satisfaction at each iteration.
* SCPO allows training of high-dimensional neural network policies while ensuring policy behavior.
* SCPO is based on a new theoretical result on Maximum Markov decision process.
* SCPO demonstrates significant performance improvement compared to existing methods and ability to handle state-wise constraints.
