**PAPER:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Task Offloading in Wireless Edge Networks
**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Task Offloading in Wireless Edge Networks
**ARXIV_ID:** 2509.01257v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a decentralized framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) to optimize its local policy while coordinating with other agents through a shared constraint vector. The framework is applied to the problem of task offloading in wireless edge computing systems.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of a decentralized framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning
* Application of the framework to task offloading in wireless edge computing systems
* Theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm
* Numerical experiments to validate the performance of the algorithm
