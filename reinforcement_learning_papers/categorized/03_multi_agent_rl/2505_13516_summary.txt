TITLE: Hierarchical Autonomous Logic-Oriented Orchestration for Multi-Agent LLM Systems
ARXIV_ID: 2505.13516v1
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: HALO is a multi-agent collaboration framework that leverages a hierarchical reasoning architecture to tackle complex interaction environments and expert-domain reasoning tasks. It consists of three modules: Adaptive Prompt Refinement, Hierarchical Reasoning Stack, and Workflow Search Engine. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore multi-agent collaboration and construct optimal workflows.

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* Introduction of a novel framework named HALO for task-oriented agent collaboration in three stages
* Experiments across three diverse tasks show that HALO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability
* HALO achieves significant improvements over competitive baselines, including a 26.1% gain in HumanEval pass@1 and a 14.4% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines
* The framework excels in handling highly complex and expert-level reasoning tasks, demonstrating its strength in tackling non-trivial reasoning tasks.
