**PAPER:** Autonomous Option Invention for Continual Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Planning
**TITLE:** Autonomous Option Invention for Continual Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Planning
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 04_hierarchical_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper presents a novel approach for autonomous option invention in continual hierarchical reinforcement learning and planning. The approach, called CHiRP, uses a conditional abstraction tree (CAT) to capture state abstractions and invents options that satisfy three key desiderata: composability, reusability, and mutual independence. CHiRP continually learns and maintains an interpretable state abstraction and uses it to invent high-level options with abstract symbolic representations.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* A novel approach for autonomous option invention in continual hierarchical reinforcement learning and planning
* A conditional abstraction tree (CAT) based method for capturing state abstractions and inventing options
* A hierarchical framework that integrates planning and learning for continual reinforcement learning
* Empirical evaluation on a diverse suite of challenging domains in continual RL setting, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and satisfaction of key conceptual desiderata for task decomposition.
