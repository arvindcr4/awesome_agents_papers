TITLE: Fully Independent Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
ARXIV_ID: 2401.15059v2
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper proposes a new learning scheme for fully independent communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where agents do not share parameters. The scheme allows independent learners to communicate with each other without sharing parameters, enabling them to learn communication strategies. The authors also investigate the impact of different network capacities on learning with and without communication.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* Proposed a new learning scheme for fully independent communication in MARL
* Demonstrated that independent learners can still learn communication strategies without sharing parameters
* Investigated the impact of different network capacities on learning with and without communication
* Showed that communication may not always be necessary and can bring useless overhead to the learning process
* Provided insights into the importance of evaluating when communication is needed or not before applying it naively
