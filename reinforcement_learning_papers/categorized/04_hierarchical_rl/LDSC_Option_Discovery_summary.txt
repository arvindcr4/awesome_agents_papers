**PAPER:** Option Discovery Using LLM-guided Semantic Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Option Discovery Using LLM-guided Semantic Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 04_hierarchical_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The proposed method, LDSC, leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide the learning process and addresses several challenges in traditional Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). LDSC operates on three levels: the subgoal policy, which oversees high-level task planning and subgoal selection; the option policy, which operates at the intermediate level by selecting and executing the appropriate option based on the chosen subgoal; and the action policy, which handles detailed actions required to complete each subgoal. The LLM is used to decouple the original goal into a sequence of subgoals, allowing the robot to focus on achieving smaller, more tractable goals in sequence.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Improved Learning Efficiency: Through LLM-generated subgoals, robots can achieve structured task completion, accelerating the learning process.
* Policy Generalization: The approach enables effective transfer of learned policies across diverse tasks, promoting generalization and adaptability in complex environments.
* Experimental Validation: The method is demonstrated to be effective through extensive experiments in diverse environments, showcasing its applicability to real-world multi-task challenges.
