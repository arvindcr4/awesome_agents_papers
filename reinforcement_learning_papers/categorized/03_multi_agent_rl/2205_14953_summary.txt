This paper proposes a novel architecture called Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems. The key idea is to cast MARL problems into sequence modeling problems, where the objective is to map agents' observation sequences to agents' optimal action sequences. Here is a summary of the paper in the required format:

**PAPER:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is A Sequence Modeling Problem

**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Transformer: A Unified Framework for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

**ARXIV_ID:** 2205.14953v3 [cs.MA]

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The proposed MAT architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder learns representations of the joint observations, and the decoder outputs actions for each individual agent in an auto-regressive manner. The encoder takes a sequence of observations in arbitrary order and passes them through several computational blocks, and the decoder generates each agent's optimal action in a sequential and auto-regressive manner.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper proposes a novel architecture for MARL problems, which casts MARL problems into sequence modeling problems.
* The proposed MAT architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on several MARL benchmarks, including StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Google Research Football.
* The paper demonstrates the strong generalization capability of MAT as a few-shot learner, which can adapt to new tasks with limited data.
* The paper provides an ablation study to investigate the importance of different components in the MAT architecture, including the encoder-decoder structure and the use of agent IDs.
