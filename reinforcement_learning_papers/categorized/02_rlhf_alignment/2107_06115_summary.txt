**TITLE:** A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Traffic Signal Control Optimization
**ARXIV_ID:** Not provided
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method for traffic signal control optimization. The algorithm uses a centralized learning and decentralized execution paradigm, where critics use additional information to streamline the training process, while actors act on their own local observations. The method is designed to address the challenges of non-stationarity, exploration-exploitation dilemma, and continuous action spaces in multi-agent environments.
