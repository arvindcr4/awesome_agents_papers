Abstract
This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In the standard
deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network’s
weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via
a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve
optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target
update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN)
and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods
replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates
using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning.
We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in
tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages
over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates
can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in
Q-learning.

Introduction

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) [27] has seen remarkable success in solving sequential decisionmaking problems [21, 18, 25, 24, 7, 8, 28, 30, 1]. In particular, deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm [21]
is a widely used approach for value-based RL, and has demonstrated human-level performance in
various complex tasks, such as playing Atari games. However, standard DQN suffers from tuning
challenges due to the periodic hard update of the target network. Specifically, the target Q-network is
updated only periodically via a hard update, where every few thousand iterations, the target network’s
weights are replaced by those of the online network. This strategy stabilizes learning but introduces a
new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. An
alternative to hard updates is incremental updates, where the target network is updated gradually at
each step. Lillicrap et al. [18] popularized this approach in deep RL, using a soft update (or Polyak
averaging), where the target parameters move toward the online parameters with a small learning rate.
While this method mitigates instability, it still requires careful tuning of the averaging weight.
To address these challenges, we introduce a novel gradient-based target update framework for Qlearning. Our approach replaces the standard hard target update with gradient-based target learning
approach, which continuously updates the target Q-function using gradient descent. In particular,

we develop DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric
gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). AGT2-DQN replaces the hard update with a continuous,
gradient-based update for the target network. Instead of copying weights infrequently, the target
network’s parameters are treated as learnable, and they are adjusted at every step using gradient
descent on a mean squared loss between the target Q-network and online Q-network. SGT2-DQN
also uses continuous gradient-based target updates, but with a symmetric coupling between the online
and target networks. Both networks are updated with loss terms that drive them toward each other’s
predictions. Morever, SGT2-DQN adds an extra regularization term to the loss functions of both
networks that penalizes the difference between the online Q-value and target Q-value for the same
state-action. This means the online and target networks influence each other’s updates, which enforces
a more balanced interaction (each network “knows” about the other’s objective).
Unlike standard DQN, where the target network is updated only periodically, our methods ensure
continuous adaptation of the target function through gradient-based learning. The advantages of our
approach are supported by experiments on benchmark reinforcement learning tasks, which show that
AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN achieve learning performance comparable to standard DQN without
significant tuning steps.
Finally, we provide theoretical analysis, which shows that both the asymmetric and symmetric
algorithms converge to the optimal Q-values in the tabular setting. In fact, for the tabular versions
of AGT2-DQN/SGT2-DQN, called Q-learning with asymmetric gradient tracking (AGT2-QL) and
Q-learning with symmetric gradient tracking (SGT2-QL), we prove that under standard assumptions,
the online and target Q estimates will converge to Q∗ (the true optimal Q-function) with probability
one.

Related works

In the original DQN [21], the target network is a copy of the online network’s weights that is held
fixed for a number of iterations and then replaced (“hard updated”) periodically. Researchers have
looked into several alternatives to this hard update mechanism: soft (Polyak) updates have been
introduced in [18]. Instead of copying the network every few thousand steps, an incremental update
can be done every step that updates the target parameters with a small learning rate towards the online
parameters. In [14, 15], the effect of the soft updates has been theoretically investigated for tabular
TD-learning and tabular Q-learning respectively.
DeepMellow [12] removes the target network entirely by modifying the Bellman update and achieves
faster learning without the target network. They replace the conventional max operator with a
Mellowmax operator, a smooth approximation of max that prevents over-optimistic value estimates.
Similarly, in [22], the authors propose adding a functional regularization (FR) therm to the DQN loss
and removing the target network, which is calle FR-DQN. In their FR-DQN algorithm, the Q-network
is trained with an extra loss term that measures the difference between the current Q-values and
those of a prior network (which is a periodically updated snapshot of the online network). This acts
similarly to a target network, but instead of using the prior network’s values as fixed targets, it uses
them as a reference to restrain the current network’s updates.
In summary, several strategies have been explored as alternatives to hard target updates. All these
methods share the goal of providing stability to Q-learning without the downsides of an abruptly
updated target. The new gradient target tracking approaches proposed in this paper contribute to this
landscape by offering a learned, continuous target update mechanism as yet another alternative to the
hard update paradigm.

Preliminaries

3.1

Markov decision problem

We consider the infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision problem and Markov decision process,
where the agent sequentially takes actions to maximize cumulative discounted rewards. In a Markov
decision process with the state-space S := {1, 2, . . . , |S|} and action-space A := {1, 2, . . . , |A|},
the decision maker selects an action a ∈ A at the current state s ∈ S, then the state transits to the
next state s′ ∈ S with probability P (s′ |s, a), and the transition incurs a reward r(s, a, s′ ) ∈ R, where
2

P (s′ |s, a) is the state transition probability from the current state s ∈ S to the next state s′ ∈ S under
action a ∈ A, and r(s, a, s′ ) is the reward function. Moreover, |S| and |A| denotes cardinalities of S
and A, respectively. For convenience, we consider a deterministic reward function and simply write
r(sk , ak , sk+1 ) =: rk+1 , k ∈ {0, 1, . . .}. A policy π maps a state s ∈ S to an action distribution
π : S → ∆A , where ∆A denotes the set of all probability distributions over the action space A. The
objective of the Markov decision problem is to find an optimal policy, π ∗ , such that the cumulative
discounted rewards over infinite time horizons is maximized, i.e.,

where γ ∈ [0, 1) is the discount factor, Θ is the set of all policies, (s0 , a0 , s1 , a1 , . . .) is a state-action
trajectory generated by the Markov chain under policy π, and E[·|π] is an expectation conditioned on
the policy π. Moreover, Q-function under policy π is defined as

and the optimal Q-function is defined as Q∗ (s, a) = Qπ (s, a) for all (s, a) ∈ S × A. Once Q∗ is
known, then an optimal policy can be retrieved by the greedy policy π ∗ (s) = arg maxa∈A Q∗ (s, a).
Throughout, we assume that the Markov decision process is ergodic so that the stationary state
distribution exists.

Deep Q-learning with gradient target tracking

Before introducing the main results, we first briefly review the standard DQN in [21]. DQN considers
the two optimal Q-function estimates, Qθ called the online Q-network, and Qθ′ called the target
Q-network. Here, θ and θ′ are called the online and target parameters, respectively. To update these
parameters, the following loss function is considered:
X
1 1
2
L(θ; B) :=
(y − Qθ (s, a))
2 |B|
′
(s,a,r,s )∈B

where B is the mini-batch uniformly sampled from the replay buffer D, |B| denotes the size of the
mini-batch, and y, fixed as a constant, is called the target, which is defined as
y = r + 1(s′ )γmaxQθ′ (s′ , a)
a∈A

Here, 1(s′ ) is an indicator function defined as

0 if s = terminal state
1(s) :=
1
else
The online Q-network Qθ is then updated through the gradient descent step
θ ← θ − α∇L(θ; B)
′
where the target parameter θ is fixed as a constant. Then, the target Q-network Qθ′ is updated
periodically by the online parameter with period C > 0
θ′ ← θ
Figure 1 shows the learning curves of DQN for different C ∈ {1, 10, 100, 200, 500} in Cartpole
environment (Open AI gym). The results show that C = 10 gives the best learning performance
among the other choices of C. As the results indicate, achieving better learning performance requires
careful selection of C, which demands extensive trials and time.
In this paper, we propose two gradient-based target learning methods for DQN: the first algorithm
is called DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN), and the second is DQN
with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). In AGT2-DQN, we employ two distinct Qnetworks, Qθ1 and Qθ2 , referred to as the online and target Q-networks, respectively. The parameters
θ1 and θ2 are called the online and target parameters, respectively. The corresponding loss functions
are defined as

(y1 − Qθ1 (s, a))

a∈A

Both θ1 and θ2 are updated through the gradient descent steps
θ1 ← θ1 − α∇θ1 L1 (θ1 ; B), θ2 ← θ2 − α∇θ2 L2 (θ2 ; B),
where α > 0 is the step-size. The overall algorithm is summarized in Appendix A. Note that the
online parameter update is identical to that in the standard DQN. The primary distinction arises from
the target parameter update, which employs the following gradient descent step for the loss function
L2 :

θ2 ← θ2 − α∇θ2 L2 (θ2 ; B) = θ2 + α
(Qθ1 (s, a) − Qθ2 (s, a))∇θ2 Qθ2 (s, a)

The above update treats the target network in DQN as a learnable parameter updated via gradient
descent, rather than updating it only periodically [21] or by polyak averaging [18]. This yields a
form of continuous update where the target slowly learns to predict the online Q-values (or some
combination thereof), instead of being replaced outright.

As noted in the previous section, the updates for the online and target parameters are asymmetric.
This asymmetry might lead to inefficiencies in finding the optimal solution since each update plays a
distinct role and does not consider the influence of the other.
The algorithm can be conceptualized as a two-player game, where the first player (online parameter
update) strives to solve the Bellman equation, while the second player (target parameter update)
aims to track the first player’s actions. In this setup, the utility functions of the two players are
asymmetric and do not consider the objectives of each other. This mismatch can lead to instability
and inefficiencies during the learning process. A potential alternative would be to design a game
where each player’s utility function explicitly incorporates the other player’s goal, leading to a more
balanced interaction. In such a framework, the utility functions would be symmetric, which could
potentially enhance the stability and efficiency of the algorithm.
Motivated by the previous discussions, we propose the second algorithm, referred to as SGT2DQN. Similar to AGT2-DQN, this algorithm also employs two Q-networks Qθ1 and Qθ2 , which are
called the online and target Q-networks, respectively. However, SGT2-DQN introduces a symmetric
approach to updating these networks, that aims to harmonize the interaction between them. In
particular, SGT2-DQN employs the following loss functions:
X
1 1

[(y1 − Qθ1 (s, a)) + β(Qθ2 (s, a) − Qθ1 (s, a)) ]

where β > 0 is a constant weight representing the regularization weight, and the targets y1 and y2
are defined as
y1 = r + 1(s′ )γ max Qθ2 (s′ , a), y2 = r + 1(s′ )γmaxQθ1 (s′ , a).
a∈A

a∈A

Next, both θ1 and θ2 are updated through the gradient descent steps
θ1 ← θ1 − α∇θ1 L1 (θ1 ; B), θ2 ← θ2 − α∇θ2 L2 (θ2 ; B),
where α > 0 is the step-size. The overall algorithm is summarized in Appendix B. In SGT2-DQN,
both the online and target networks interact and adjust towards each other using gradient steps.
Moreover, this algorithm echoes the idea of double Q-learning in a gradient setting. Double Qlearning maintains two estimates that learn from each other’s predictions [9]. SGT2-DQN similarly
lets two function approximators co-evolve and correct one another.
Figure 2 illustrates the learning curves of AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN for different β ∈
{0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100} in Cartpole environment. The results demonstrate that their learning
efficiency is comparable to DQN. However, one can observe that they are less sensitive to the
hyperparameter β.

Figure 3 illustrates the learning curves of DQN with C = 10, AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN with
β = 50, where the hyperparameter for each method has been selected to achieve approximately the
best performance among the tested grid points.
The results show that while DQN exhibits slightly better learning efficiency than the proposed methods
in this environment. However, as mentioned before, the latter require less efforts for hyperparameter
tuning in this case.
We conducted similar experiments across multiple environments, and the results varied depending on
the environment. For instance, comparisons of learning curves are presented in Figure 4, where the
hyperparameters were roughly tuned to achieve optimal learning performance for each method.
As shown in Figure 4(a), DQN with C = 50, AGT2-DQN with β = 0.1, and SGT2-DQN with β = 1
demonstrate comparable performance in the Acrobot environment. In contrast, Figure 4(b) illustrates
that AGT2-DQN with β = 0.1 and SGT2-DQN with β = 0.1 exhibit better learning efficiency than
DQN with C = 500. A full comparison of results, including those with different hyperparameter
settings, is provided in the Appendix J. Moreover, Appendix J also includes comparisons in other
environments, which exhibit similar trends.
Overall, DQN, AGT2-DQN, and SGT2-DQN exhibited comparable learning performance on average.
In some environments, DQN outperformed the other two methods, while in others, AGT2-DQN and
SGT2-DQN achieved better learning performance than DQN. However, we observed that AGT2-DQN
and SGT2-DQN were slightly less sensitive to hyperparameters than DQN on average. Therefore, it
is difficult to conclude that the proposed AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN outperform DQN. However,
we argue that they offer interesting alternatives to the hard update paradigm in DQN.

Beyond the tuning issue, our experience suggests that AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN achieve faster
learning speeds than DQN during the early learning phase. However, they frequently encounter
performance collapse after this phase. Similar to policy gradient methods, this collapse appears to
result from overshooting in the gradient target update, a phenomenon that may not occur in standard
DQN. We believe this issue can be mitigated by incorporating stabilization techniques, such as
clipping the loss function, similar to the approach used in proximal policy optimization (PPO) in [24].

Analysis of optimality

The proposed AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN aim to minimize their respective loss functions through
gradient descent steps. However, it is not currently clear how minimizing these errors in the loss
functions ensures that the computed Q-estimates are closer to the optimal Q-function. Therefore,
further investigation is required to establish a more definitive link between the reduction of loss
function errors and the accuracy of the Q-estimates in approximating the optimal Q-function. This
6

issue is the main goal of this section and will be critical for validating the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.
To simplify the analysis, let us assume that by minimizing the loss functions of AGT2-DQN, we can
approximately minimize the following expected loss functions:
h
i
2
L1 (θ1 ) =E(s,a)∼U (S×A),s′ ∼P (·|s,a) (r(s, a, s′ ) + γmaxa∈A Qθ2 (s′ , a) − Qθ1 (s, a))

2
L2 (θ2 ) =E(s,a)∼U (S×A),s′ ∼P (·|s,a)

2
where U (S × A) means the uniform distribution over the set S × A. Note that we employ the uniform
distribution over S × A to simplify the analysis. In practice, this would correspond to the average
distribution of S × A in the replay buffer.
Next, suppose that the loss functions are minimized with
L1 (θ1 ) ≤ ε, L2 (θ2 ) ≤ ε,
where ε > 0 is a small number representing the maximum error of the two loss functions. Then, we
can derive the following error bounds on the corresponding solution:
Theorem 1. Suppose that the loss functions are minimized with
L1 (θ1 ) ≤ ε, L2 (θ2 ) ≤ ε.

Moreover, the errors also depend on β > 0 and as β → ∞ the error tends to be reduced.

Convergence analysis for tabular case

In this section, we provide theoretical convergence analysis of AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN in tabular
cases for conceptual investigations, where the tabular versions of AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN are
called Q-learning with asymmetric gradient tracking (AGT2-QL) and Q-learning with symmetric
gradient tracking (SGT2-QL), respectively. Let us first consider the following update of AGT2-QL:

k+1 (sk , ak ) = Qk (sk , ak ) + αk β(Qk (sk , ak ) − Qk (sk , ak )).
where αk > 0 is the learning rate, β > 0 is a constant weight, and s′k can be interpreted in the
following two ways: 1) in the Markovian observation model, s′k = sk+1 , i.e., the next state and 2) in
the i.i.d. observation model, s′k is the next state sampled at the current time, while it is not identical
to sk+1 . In the second i.i.d. observation model, s′k is sampled independently from some distribution

d. In this paper, we consider the i.i.d. observation model for our convergence analysis to simplify the
overall analysis. However, we note that the analysis presented in this paper for the i.i.d. observation
model can be extended to the Markovian observation model with some modifications [19]. We also
acknowledge that such more sophisticated analyses are not the main focus in this paper. The main
goal of the convergence analysis in this section is to provide conceptual insights into the convergence
of the proposed algorithms. We also note that simulation results are provided in the Appendix G to
demonstrate the validity and convergence of AGT2-QL. Empirically, the results show that AGT2-QL
tends to converge faster for larger values of β > 0.

We note that this algorithm is similar to the so-called averaging Q-learning developed in [15], which
can be seen as a precursor. The averaging Q-learning in [15] maintains two separate estimates,
A
A
the target estimate QB
k and the online estimate Qk : the online estimate Qk is for approximating
Q-function and updated through an online manner, whereas the target estimate QB
k is for computing
the target values and updated through taking Polyak’s averaging. Only the difference is the update
rule for QB
k which depends on the transition (sk , ak ).
AGT2-QL can be seen as a tabular version of AGT2-DQN due to the following insights: if we
consider the two loss functions
1
β
lA (QA ) := (y1 − QA (sk , ak ))2 , lB (QB ) := (y2 − QB (sk , ak ))2

2
with
y1 = rk+1 + 1(s′k )γ max QB
y2 = QA

k (sk , ak )

then each update in AGT2-QL can be interpreted as the gradient descent steps

(2)
k+1 (sk , ak ) = Qk (sk , ak ) − αk

In other words, AGT2-QL can be seen as an tabular and online implementation of AGT2-DQN,
whose convergence can be established as follows:

sk is sampled from a fixed state distribution d. Then for any β > 0, QA

The corresponding convergence analysis is given in Appendix E. In AGT2-QL, the update for the
A
target estimate QB
k and the online estimate Qk are different, resulting in asymmetric updates for the
two values. We can extend the idea in AGT2-QL by symmetrizing the update rule. In particular, by
adding the two targets y1 and y2 and switching the roles of the target and online estimates, one can

which can be seen as a tabular counterpart of SGT2-DQN.

We can observe that now the updates for the online and target estimates QB
k and Qk are symmetric.
We also note that this variant can be seen as a Q-learning counterpart of the double TD-learning
developed in [14]. In this paper, we establish its convergence as follows:
Theorem 4. Let us consider SGT2-QL and assume that the step-size satisfies (3). Assume that
(sk , ak , s′k ) are i.i.d. samples, where ak is sampled from the fixed behavior policy b and sk is sampled

from a fixed state distribution d. Then for any β > 0, QA

The proof is provided in the Appendix F. We note that the convergence of SGT2-QL and its analysis
have not yet been investigated in the literature. Additionally, empirical results demonstrating the
convergence of this algorithm are included in the Appendix G. These results show that SGT2-QL
generally converges faster than AGT2-QL. Moreover, they indicate that the convergence speed of
SGT2-QL is less sensitive to the weight β > 0 compared to AGT2-QL.

Conclusion

This paper introduces gradient target tracking frameworks as alternatives to the hard target update in
DQN. By replacing the periodic target updates with a continuous gradient-based tracking mechanism,
the proposed approach mitigates tuning challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes the convergence
of the proposed methods in tabular settings. These findings suggest that the gradient-based target
tracking is a promising alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in reinforcement
learning.

Convergence analysis with ODE model

C.1

Basics of nonlinear system theory

Let us consider the nonlinear system
d
xt = f (xt ), x0 = z, t ∈ R+ ,
(4)
dt
n
n
n
where xt ∈ R is the state, f : R → R is a nonlinear mapping, and R+ denotes the set of
nonnegative real numbers. For simplicity, we assume that the solution to (4) exists and is unique. In
fact, this holds true so long as the mapping f is globally Lipschitz continuous.
Lemma 1 ([11, Theorem 3.2]). Let us consider the nonlinear system (4) and assume that f is globally
Lipschitz continuous, i.e.,
∥f (x) − f (y)∥ ≤ L∥x − y∥, ∀x, y ∈ Rn ,
(5)
n
for some L > 0 and norm ∥ · ∥, then it has a unique solution x(t) for all t ≥ 0 and x(0) ∈ R .
An important concept in dealing with the nonlinear system is the equilibrium point. A point x = xe
in the state space is said to be an equilibrium point of (4) if it has the property that whenever the
state of the system starts at xe , it will remain at xe [11]. For (4), the equilibrium points are the
real roots of the equation f (x) = 0. The equilibrium point xe is said to be globally asymptotically
stable if for any initial state x0 ∈ Rn , xt → xe as t → ∞. Now, we provide a vector comparison
principle [29, 10, 23] for multi-dimensional O.D.E., which will play a central role in the analysis
below. We first introduce the quasi-monotone increasing function, which is a necessary prerequisite
for the comparison principle.
Definition 1 (Quasi-monotone function). A vector-valued function f : Rn → Rn with f :=
T
[f1 f2 · · · fn ] is said to be quasi-monotone increasing if fi (x) ≤ fi (y) holds for all i ∈
{1, 2, . . . , n} and x, y ∈ Rn such that xi = yi and xj ≤ yj for all j ̸= i.
An example of a quasi-monotone increasing function f is f (x) = Ax where A is a Metzler matrix,
which implies the off-diagonal elements of A are nonnegative. Now, we introduce a vector comparison
principle. For completeness, we provide a simple proof tailored to our interests.
Lemma 2 (Vector comparison principle [10, Theorem 3.2]). Suppose that f and f are globally
Lipschitz continuous. Let vt be a solution of the system
d
xt = f (xt ), x0 ∈ Rn , ∀ t ≥ 0,
dt
assume that f is quasi-monotone increasing, and let vt be a solution of the system
d
vt = f (vt ), v0 < x0 , ∀t ≥ 0,
(6)
dt
where f (v) ≤ f (v) holds for any v ∈ Rn . Then, vt ≤ xt for all t ≥ 0.
Proof. Instead of (6), first consider
d
vε (t) = f (vε (t)) − ε1n , vε (0) < x(0), ∀t ≥ 0
dt
where ε > 0 is a sufficiently small real number and 1n is a vector where all elements are ones, where
we use a different notation for the time index for convenience. Suppose that the statement is not true,
and let
t∗ := inf{t ≥ 0 : ∃i such that vε,i (t) > xi (t)} < ∞,
and let i be such index. By the definition of t∗ , we have that vε,i (t∗ ) = xi (t∗ ) and vε,j (t∗ ) ≤ xj (t∗ )
for any j ̸= i. Then, since f is quasi-monotone increasing, we have
f i (vε (t∗ )) ≤ f i (x(t∗ )).

(7)

On the other hand, by the definition of t∗ , there exists a small δ > 0 such that
vε,i (t∗ + ∆t) > xi (t∗ + ∆t)
for all 0 < ∆t < δ. Dividing both sides by ∆t and taking the limit ∆t → 0, we have
v̇ε,i (t∗ ) ≥ ẋi (t∗ ) = f i (x(t∗ )).
14

(8)

By the hypothesis, it holds that
d
vε (t) = f (vε (t)) − ε1n < f (vε (t)) ≤ f (vε (t))
dt
holds for all t ≥ 0. The inequality implies v̇ε,i (t) < f i (vε (t)), which in combination with (8) leads
to f i (vε (t∗ )) > f i (x(t∗ )). However, it contradicts with (7). Therefore, vε (t) ≤ x(t) holds for all
t ≥ 0. Since the solution vε (t) continuously depends on ε > 0 [29, Chap. 13], taking the limit ε → 0,
we conclude v0 (t) ≤ x(t) holds for all t ≥ 0. This completes the proof.
C.2

Switching system theory

Let us consider the particular nonlinear system, the switched linear system,
d
xt = Aσt xt , x0 = z ∈ Rn , t ∈ R+ ,
(9)
dt
where xt ∈ Rn is the state, σ ∈ M := {1, 2, . . . , M } is called the mode, σt ∈ M is called the
switching signal, and {Aσ , σ ∈ M} are called the subsystem matrices. The switching signal can be
either arbitrary or controlled by the user under a certain switching policy. Especially, a state-feedback
switching policy is denoted by σ(xt ). To prove the global asymptotic stability of the switching
system, we will use a fundamental algebraic stability condition of switching systems reported in [20].
More comprehensive surveys of stability of switching systems can be found in [20] and [17].
Lemma 3 ([20, Theorem 8]). The origin of the linear switching system (9) is the unique globally
asymptotically stable equilibrium point under arbitrary switchings, σt , if and only if there exist a full
column rank matrix , L ∈ Rm×n , m ≥ n, and a family of matrices, Āσ ∈ Rm×n , σ ∈ M, with the
so-called strictly negative row dominating diagonal condition, i.e., for each Āσ , σ ∈ M, its elements
satisfying
X
[Āσ ]ii +
|[Āσ ]ij | < 0, ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m},
j∈{1,2,...,n}\{i}

where [·]ij is the (i, j)-element of a matrix (·), such that the matrix relations
LAσ = Āσ L,

∀σ ∈ M,

are satisfied.
A more general class of systems is the affine switching system
d
xt = Aσt xt + bσt , x0 = z ∈ Rn , t ∈ R+ ,
(10)
dt
n
where bσt ∈ R is the additional input vector. Due to the additional input bσk , its stabilization
becomes much more challenging.
C.3

ODE-based stochastic approximation

Due to its generality, the convergence analyses of many RL algorithms rely on the ODE (ordinary
differential equation) approach [3, 13]. It analyzes convergence of general stochastic recursions by
examining stability of the associated ODE model based on the fact that the stochastic recursions with
diminishing step-sizes approximate the corresponding ODEs in the limit. One of the most popular
approach is based on the Borkar and Meyn theorem [4]. We now briefly introduce the Borkar and
Meyn’s ODE approach for analyzing convergence of the general stochastic recursions
θk+1 = θk + αk (f (θk ) + εk+1 )
(11)
where f : Rn → Rn is a nonlinear mapping. Basic technical assumptions are given below.
Assumption 1.
1. The mapping f : Rn → Rn is globally Lipschitz continuous and there exists a function
f∞ : Rn → Rn such that
f (cx)
lim
= f∞ (x), ∀x ∈ Rn .
c→∞
c
2. The origin in Rn is an asymptotically stable equilibrium for the ODE ẋt = f∞ (xt ).
15

3. There exists a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium θe ∈ Rn for the ODE
ẋt = f (xt ), i.e., xt → θe as t → ∞.
4. The sequence {εk , Gk , k ≥ 1} with Gk = σ(θi , εi , i ≤ k) is a Martingale difference
sequence. In addition, there exists a constant C0 < ∞ such that for any initial θ0 ∈ Rn , we
have E[∥εk+1 ∥2 |Gk ] ≤ C0 (1 + ∥θk ∥2 ), ∀k ≥ 0.
P∞
P∞
5. The step-sizes satisfy αk > 0, k=0 αk = ∞, k=0 αk2 < ∞.
Lemma 4 ([4, Borkar and Meyn theorem]). Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. For any initial
θ0 ∈ Rn , supk≥0 ∥θk ∥ < ∞ with probability one. In addition, θk → θe as k → ∞ with probability
one.
The Borkar and Meyn theorem states that under Assumption 1, the stochastic process (θk )∞
k=0
generated by (11) is bounded and converges to θe almost surely.

D

Assumptions and definitions

In this paper, we focus on the following setting: {(sk , ak , s′k )}∞
k=0 are i.i.d. samples under the
behavior policy β, where the time-invariant behavior policy is the policy by which the RL agent
actually behaves to collect experiences. Note that the notation s′k implies the next state sampled at
the time step k, which is used instead of sk+1 in order to distinguish s′k from sk+1 . In this paper, the
notation sk+1 indicate the current state at the iteration step k + 1, while it does not depend on sk .
For simplicity, we assume that the state at each time is sampled from the stationary state distribution
p, and in this case, the state-action distribution at each time is identically given by
d(s, a) = p(s)b(a|s), (s, a) ∈ S × A.
In this paper, we assume that the behavior policy b is time-invariant, and this scenario excludes the
common method of using the ε-greedy behavior policy with ε > 0 because the ε-greedy behavior
policy depends on the current Q-iterate, and hence is time-varying. Moreover, the proposed analysis
cannot be easily extended to the analysis of Q-learning with the ε-greedy behavior policy. However,
we note that this assumption is common in the ODE approaches for Q-learning and TD-learning [26].
This assumption can be relaxed by considering a time-varying distribution. However, this direction
will not be addressed in this paper to simplify the presentation of the proofs.
Throughout, we make the following assumption for convenience.
Assumption 2. d(s, a) > 0 holds for all (s, a) ∈ S × A.
This assumption ensures that every state-action pair is visited infinitely often for sufficient exploration.
It is applied when the state-action occupation frequency is given and has also been considered in [16]
and [5]. The work in [2] introduces an alternative exploration condition, known as the cover time
condition, which states that within a certain time period, every state-action pair is expected to be
visited at least once. Slightly different variations of the cover time condition have been used in [6]
and [16] for convergence rate analysis.
Throughout the paper, we will use the following matrix notations for compact dynamical system

P ∈ R|S×A|×|S| , R ∈ R|S×A| , Q ∈ R|S×A| , and D ∈ R|S×A|×|S×A| . In this notation, Q-function
is encoded as a single vector Q ∈ R|S×A| , which enumerates Q(s, a) for all s ∈ S and a ∈ A. In
particular, the single value Q(s, a) can be written as
Q(s, a) = (ea ⊗ es )T Q,
16

where es ∈ R|S| and ea ∈ R|A| are s-th basis vector (all components are 0 except for the s-th
component which is 1) and a-th basis vector, respectively. Note also that under Assumption 2, D is a
nonsingular diagonal matrix with strictly positive diagonal elements.
For any stochastic policy, π : S → ∆A , where ∆A is the set of all probability distributions over A,
we define the corresponding action transition matrix as

where es ∈ R|S| . Then, it is well known that P Ππ ∈ R|S×A|×|S×A| is the transition probability
matrix of the state-action pair under policy π. If we consider a deterministic policy, π : S → A, the
stochastic policy can be replaced with the corresponding one-hot encoding vector ⃗π (s) := eπ(s) ∈
∆A , where ea ∈ R|A| , and the corresponding action transition matrix is identical to (12) with
π replaced with ⃗π . For any given Q ∈ R|S×A| , denote the greedy policy w.r.t. Q as πQ (s) :=
arg maxa∈A Q(s, a) ∈ A. We will use the following shorthand frequently: ΠQ := ΠπQ .

Convergence of AGT2-QL

We now analyze the convergence of AGT2-QL using the same switching system approach [15].

In particular, the main theoretical tool is the Borkar and Meyn theorem [4]. To apply this framework,
it is crucial to study the corresponding ODE model and its asymptotic stability. Therefore, in the next
subsection, we first derive the ODE model for AGT2-QL.

The above system is a linear switching system discussed in Appendix C.2. More precisely, let Θ be
the set of all deterministic policies, let us define a one-to-one mapping φ : Θ → {1, 2, . . . , |Θ × Θ|}
from two deterministic policies (πA , πB ) ∈ Θ × Θ to an integer in {1, 2, . . . , |Θ × Θ|}, and define

Until now, we have derived an ODE model of AGT2-QL. The next goal is to prove its asymptotic
stability which is essential step to apply the Borkar and Meyn theorem [4]. Notably, proving the global
asymptotic stability of the above switching system without the affine term is relatively straightforward
using Lemma 3. However, existing theories do not support switching systems that include affine
terms.
To address this issue, we construct two comparison systems by leveraging the special structure of the
switching system and the greedy policy, and we establish their global asymptotic stability. Building
on the vector comparison principle introduced in Lemma 2, we then prove the asymptotic stability of
the desired affine switching system. We note that this approach was first proposed in [15], and we
follow its framework with modifications tailored to the proposed algorithms.

Lemma 6. f is quasi-monotone increasing.
Proof. We will check the condition of the quasi-monotone increasing function for f1 and f2 , separately. Assume that ∆x1 ∈ R|S|||A| and ∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element
of ∆x1 is zero. For f1 , using Lemma 5, we have
eTi f1 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 )
= − eTi D(x1 + ∆x1 ) + γeTi DP Πx2 +∆x2 +Q∗ (x2 + ∆x2 + Q∗ ) − γeTi DP ΠQ∗ Q∗

=eTi f1 (x1 , x2 ),
where the second line is due to −eTi D∆x1 = 0. Similarly, assuming that ∆x1 ∈ R|S|||A| and
∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element of ∆x2 is zero, we get
eTi f2 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 ) =βeTi D(x1 + ∆x1 ) − βeTi D(x2 + ∆x2 )
=βeTi D(x1 + ∆x1 ) − βeTi Dx2

=eTi f2 (x1 , x2 ),
where the second line is due to eTi D∆x2 = 0. Therefore, f is quasi-monotone increasing.

In the following lemmas, we establish key properties of the upper comparison system.
Lemma 8. h is quasi-monotone increasing.
Proof. We will check the condition of the quasi-monotone increasing function for h1 and h2 , separately. Assume that ∆x1 ∈ R|S|||A| and ∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element
of ∆x1 is zero. For h1 , we have
eTi h1 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 ) = − eTi D(x1 + ∆x1 ) + γeTi DP Πx2 +∆x2 (x2 + ∆x2 )
= − eTi Dx1 + γeTi DP Πx2 +∆x2 (x2 + ∆x2 )
≥ − eTi Dy1 + γeTi DP Πx2 x2
=eTi h1 (x1 , x2 ),
where the second line is due to −eTi D∆x1 = 0. Similarly, assuming that ∆x1 ∈ R|S|||A| and
∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element of ∆x2 is zero, we get
eTi h2 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 ) =βeTi D(x1 + ∆x1 ) − βeTi D(x2 + ∆x2 )
=βeTi D(x1 + ∆x1 ) − βeTi Dx2
≥βeTi Dx1 − βeTi Dx2
=eTi h2 (x1 , x2 ),
where the second line is due to eTi D∆x2 = 0. Therefore, h is quasi-monotone increasing.
Lemma 9. h is globally Lipshcitz continuous.
Proof. We complete the proof through the inequalities
∥h(x1 , x2 ) − h(y1 , y2 )∥∞

Based on the previous lemmas, we are now ready to prove that the solution of the upper comparison
system indeed upper-bounds the solution of the original system, which is the reason why (16) is
named as such.

Next, we prove that the upper comparison system (16) is globally asymptotically stable at the origin.
Notably, the proof is simpler than that of the original system, as the upper comparison system does
not include the affine term.
Lemma 12. For any β > 0, the origin is the unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point
of the upper comparison system (16).
Proof. For notational convenience, we define Πσ , σ ∈ M as ΠQB
such that σ = ψ(πQB

By Lemma 3, the origin of the upper comparison system is globally asymptotically stable.

Moreover, the next lemma proves that the lower comparison system is also globally asymptotically

Lemma 16. For any β > 0, the origin is the unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point
of the lower comparison system (17).
Proof. The proof follows the same procedure as that of the upper comparison system. Therefore, the
detailed proof is omitted here to avoid repetition.
So far, we have established several key properties of the upper and lower comparison systems,
including their global asymptotic stability. In the next subsection, we prove the global asymptotic
stability of the original system based on these results.

systems are depicted in Figure 5 for QA
t part and Figure 6 for Qt part. The results empirically prove
that the ODE model associated with AGT2-QL is asymptotically stable. Moreover, they illustrate that
the solutions of the upper and lower comparison systems bound the solution of the original system,
as established by the theory.

Convergence of AGT2-QL

We can now apply the Borkar and Meyn theorem, Lemma 4, to prove Theorem 3. First of all, note
that the system in (15) corresponds to the ODE model in Assumption 1. The proof is completed by
examining all the statements in Assumption 1:

Lemma 17. The function f can be represented by

−(1 + β)Dx2 + βDx1 + γDP Πx1 +Q∗ (x1 + Q∗ ) − γDP ΠQ∗ Q∗
This completes the proof.
Lemma 18. f is quasi-monotone increasing.
Proof. We will check the condition of the quasi-monotone increasing function for f1 and f2 , separately. Assume that ∆x1 ∈ R|S|||A| and ∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element
of ∆x1 is zero. For f1 , using Lemma 17, we have
eTi f1 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 )
= − (1 + β)eTi D(x1 + ∆x1 ) + βD(x2 + ∆x2 )
+ γeTi DP Πx2 +∆x2 +Q∗ (x2 + ∆x2 + Q∗ ) − γeTi DP ΠQ∗ Q∗

=eTi f1 (x1 , x2 ),
where the second line is due to −(1 + β)eTi D∆x1 = 0. Similarly, assuming that ∆x1 ∈ R|S|||A|
and ∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element of ∆x2 is zero, we get
eTi f2 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 ) ≥ eTi f2 (x1 , x2 ),
by symmetry. Therefore, h is quasi-monotone increasing.

Lemma 20. h is quasi-monotone increasing.
Proof. We will check the condition of the quasi-monotone increasing function for h1 and h2 , separately. Assume that ∆x1 ∈ R|S|||A| and ∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element
29

of ∆x1 is zero. For h1 , we have
eTi h1 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 )

∆x2 ∈ R|S|||A| are nonnegative vectors, and an ithe element of ∆x2 is zero, we get
eTi h2 (x1 + ∆x1 , x2 + ∆x2 ) ≥ eTi h2 (x1 , x2 ),
by symmetry. Therefore, h is quasi-monotone increasing.

Proof. The desired conclusion is obtained by Lemma 2with Lemmas 18, 19, 25 and 26.
Moreover, the next lemma proves that the lower comparison system is also globally asymptotically
stable at the origin.
Lemma 28. For any β > 0, the origin is the unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point
of the lower comparison system (21).
Proof. For the proof, one can apply the same procedure as in the proof of the upper comparison
system.
So far, we have established several key properties of the upper and lower comparison systems,
including their global asymptotic stability. In the next subsection, we prove the global asymptotic
stability of the original system based on these results.

As before, the simulation study empirically proves that the ODE model associated with SGT2-QL is
asymptotically stable. Moreover, they illustrate that the solutions of the upper and lower comparison
systems bound the solution of the original system, as established by the theory.
So far, we have examined key properties of the ODE model of SGT2-QL and proved its global
asymptotic stability, which is essential for establishing the convergence of SGT2-QL. In the next
subsection, we will analyze its convergence in detail.

Convergence of SGT2-QL

In this subsection, we apply the Borkar and Meyn theorem, Lemma 4, to prove the convergence of
SGT2-QL in Theorem 4. First of all, note that the system in (15) corresponds to the ODE model
in Assumption 1. The proof is completed by examining all the statements in Assumption 1:

To proceed, let us define the history

Moreover, let us define the corresponding process (Mk )∞
k=0 with Mk :=
i=1 εi . Then, we can
prove that (Mk )∞
k=0 is Martingale. To do so, we can easily prove E[εk+1 |Gk ] = 0. Using this identity,
we have

Therefore, (Mk )∞

Moreover, it can be easily proved that the fourth condition of Assumption 1 is satisfied by algebraic
calculations. Therefore, the fourth condition is met.

also demonstrate the convergence, but with different convergence trends for varying weight β. In
particular, the error evolutions show that SGT2-QL generally converges faster than AGT2-QL, and
the convergence speeds are less sensitive to β.

Additionally, we conduct experiments using grid world environments, including Taxi, FrozenLake,
and CliffWalk, in OpenAI Gym. Figure 13 presents reward curves for the Taxi environment, which
shows trends similar to previous results: AGT2-QL exhibits better learning performance for higher
values of β, whereas SGT2-QL is not significantly affected by the choice of β.
Similarly,Figure 14 presents reward curves for the FrozenLake environment, whileFigure 15 shows
reward curves for the CliffWalk environment. All results demonstrate that the proposed approaches,
AGT2-QL and SGT2-QL, are valid and effectively learn the optimal policy. Moreover, the learning
speeds of AGT2-QL and SGT2-QL are comparable to that of standard Q-learning.
