Abstract Snippet:
Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning  Volodymyr Mnih  Koray Kavukcuoglu  David Silver  arXiv:1312.5602v1 [cs.LG] 19 Dec 2013  Daan Wierstra  Alex Graves  Ioannis Antonoglou  Martin Riedmiller  DeepMind Technologies {vlad,koray,david,alex.graves,ioannis,daan,martin.riedmiller} @ deepmind.com  Abstract We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a va...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards."
- "We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
