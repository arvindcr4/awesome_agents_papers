Abstract Snippet:
Adjoint Matching: Fine-tuning Flow and Diffusion Generative Models with Memoryless Stochastic Optimal Control Carles Domingo-Enrich1 , Michal Drozdzal1 , Brian Karrer1 , Ricky T. Q. Chen1  arXiv:2409.08861v5 [cs.LG] 7 Jan 2025  1  FAIR, Meta  Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there have not been many theoreticallysound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, ...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
