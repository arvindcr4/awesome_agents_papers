**ARXIV_ID:** 2509.17042v1 [cs.RO]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** 
The proposed framework, called Orchestrate, Generate, Reflect (OGR), leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automate the design of reward functions and training curricula for reinforcement learning (RL) policies in autonomous driving tasks. OGR consists of an orchestration module, a generation module, a reflection module, and a memory module. The orchestration module plans high-level training objectives, while the generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process to produce reward-curriculum pairs. The reflection module facilitates iterative optimization based on online evaluation, and the memory module stores multimodal experiences generated throughout the training process.

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS:**
- Introduced a novel automated RL policy learning framework that leverages VLM-based multi-agent collaboration for autonomous driving tasks.
- Proposed a two-step reward-curriculum generation module that analyzes the current training goal and contextual signals before synthesizing corresponding reward functions and curriculum instances.
- Developed a human-in-the-loop mechanism for reward observation space augmentation to dynamically expand the environment observation code.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework through comprehensive experiments and real-world demonstrations.
- Showed that the framework can be applied to various urban driving scenarios, including multi-lane overtaking, on-ramp merging, and unsignalized intersections, with minimal human effort and time costs for adaptation.
