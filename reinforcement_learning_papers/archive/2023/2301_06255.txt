Hermitian Hamiltonians with time-periodic coefficients can be analyzed via Floquet theory, and
have been extensively used for engineering Floquet Hamiltonians in standard quantum simulators.
Generalized to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, time-periodicity offers avenues to engineer the landscape of Floquet quasi-energies across the complex plane. We investigate two-level non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians with coefficients that have different periodicities using Floquet theory. By analytical and numerical calculations, we obtain their regions of stability, defined by real Floquet quasienergies, and contours of exceptional point (EP) degeneracies. We extend our analysis to study
the phases that accompany these cyclic changes. Our results demonstrate that time-periodic, nonHermitian Hamiltonians generate a rich landscape of stable and unstable regions.

INTRODUCTION

Time-dependent Schrödinger equations are in general
difficult to solve analytically and usually one has to resort to using perturbation or numerical methods. One
of the few analytically solvable time-dependent models is
the Rabi model [1], which is a two-level system driven by
an oscillatory classical field. Its key feature is that when
the field frequency is close to the energy-level gap of the
two-level system, the system undergoes complete population inversion at an arbitrarily small field strength.
Following the Rabi model, Shirley developed a formalism for periodically driven systems using Floquet theory
[2–4]. Over the years, there has been an increasing interest in studying time-periodic driven systems for applications in control and sensing. Examples can be found
in the engineering of quantum materials [5], topological structures [6–8], controlling inter-well tunneling of a
Bose-Einstein condensate [9] and detecting low-frequency
magnetic fields [10].
During the past quarter of a century, research on nonHermitian systems incorporating parity-time inversion or
PT -symmetries has also seen tremendous growth [11,
12]. Such open systems with balanced, spatiotemporally separated gain and loss, are described by effective, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians H with PT symmetry, [H, PT ] = 0 [13]. This antilinear symmetry implies
that the Hamiltonian eigenvalues are either real or occur in complex-conjugate pairs, with the PT -symmetry
breaking transition occurring at exceptional point (EP)
degeneracies where corresponding eigenmodes also coalesce. These remarkable properties have allowed complex
extensions of quantum theory [14–18]. The realization of
PT -symmetry as a pair of optical waveguides [19–22] further fueled the growth of work on the experimental side

in a wide range of areas including unidirectional invisibility [23], electrical circuits [24–26], photonic lattices [27],
mechanics [28], optical resonators [29], acoustics [30], as
well as in minimal quantum systems [31–35].
A decade ago, new symmetry called anti-PT symmetry (APT -symmetry) was introduced in nonHermitian systems and was realized as balanced negative
and positive refractive index materials [36]. A system is
said to have APT -symmetry if the PT operator anticommutes with the Hamiltonian H 0 , i.e. {H 0 , PT } = 0.
Although, prima facie, the two symmetries appear distinct, it is easy to check that H is PT symmetric if and
only if the Hamiltonian H 0 = iH has the APT symmetry. Such Hamiltonians have been realized in flying
atoms [37], optical waveguides with imaginary couplings
[38], optical four-wave mixing in cold atoms [39], Lorentz
dynamics [40], diffusive systems [41], qubits [42], nonlinear dimers [43], and trapped ions [44, 45].
When PT -symmetries were introduced for Floquet
systems, this brought numerous novel phenomena that
fundamentally arise due to the interplay between periodic gain-loss variation and oscillatory, unitary dynamics introduced by a static, Hermitian Hamiltonian. For
PT -symmetric Hamiltonians with a single drive—an oscillatory gain-loss term or an oscillatory Hermitian term,
but not both— this led to a rich landscape of PT symmetric, stable regions and PT -broken unstable regions separated by contours of EPs. This landscape
contains PT -broken regions at vanishingly small gainloss strengths, as well as PT -symmetric regions at arbitrarily large gain-loss strengths, at specific modulation frequencies [46–48]. Non-Hermitian Floquet dynamics with PT -symmetries have been investigated in ultracold atoms [49], nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers [50], superconducting qubits [51, 52], electrical circuits [53, 54]
and [55, 56], which also includes systems without PT symmetries. These extensive investigations, however,
have been limited to single-frequency drives.
Here, we investigate PT -symmetric and APT symmetric Hamiltonians where the Hermitian or gainloss terms have different periodicities, by using the Flo-

2
quet formalism. We determine the stable (real Floquet
eigenvalues) and unstable (complex conjugate Flqouet
eigenvalues) regions numerically by using the frequencydomain Floquet Hamiltonian HF and analytically from
eigenvalues of the non-unitary, one-period time-evolution
operator G(T ) ≡ exp(−iHF T ). Subsequently, we use
the cyclic variations of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
to obtain the bi-orthogonal Berry phase [57–59] for our
models. The plan for the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we
set out the formalism and establish the notation for both
PT -symmetric and APT -symmetric models that we consider. We present the stability phase diagrams for the
PT -symmetric case, and discuss their common, salient
features, followed by corresponding results for the APT symmetric models. In Sec. III, we present the results for
the geometric phases acquired during cyclic variations.
We conclude the paper with a brief discussion in Sec. IV.

FLOQUET FORMALISM

For a two-level system, a general Hamiltonian is given
by H(t) = A(t) · σ + iB(t) · σ where A(t), B(t) are real
vectors and σ = (X, Y, Z) denotes the vector with the
Pauli matrices. Since all 2 × 2 matrices are encoded here,
the requisite antilinear symmetry imposes a further constraint of A · B = 0. We emphasize that since the Pauli
matrices form an orthogonal basis for all 2 × 2 matrices,
arbitrary PT symmetric and APT -symmetric Hamiltonians can be written in this form.
For a time-periodic Hamiltonian, the instantaneous
eigenvalues λk (t) of H(t) = H(t + T ) do not determine
the dynamics. The long-term dynamics of the system, instead, are determined by the spectrum of the corresponding Floquet Hamiltonian HF = H(t) − i∂t (~ = 1), represented as an infinite-dimensional, non-diagonal matrix in
the frequency space. If H(t) contains sinusoidal timedependence, then the frequency-space Floquet Hamiltonian HF is tridiagonal [46, 47], whereas if H(t) has
piecewise constant entries with sharp changes, the matrix HF has nonzero entries throughout. The spectrum
of the Floquet Hamiltonian HF (ω1 , ω2 ), comprising Floquet quasienergies nα = α + nω, changes from purely
real to complex conjugate pairs as a function of the nonHermiticity strength γ and frequency ω ≡ 2π/T of modulation. An alternate method is to obtain the one-period
RT
time-evolution operator G(T ) = T exp(−i 0 H(t0 )dt0 )
where T denotes time-ordered product that takes into
account the non-commuting nature of Hamiltonians at
different instances of time. The 2 × 2 non-unitary operator G(T ) can also be used to define the Floquet Hamiltonian within the folded-zone scheme [46, 47] with two
Floquet eigenenergies α . If one uses piecewise constant
Hamiltonian H(t), the operator G(T ) can be analytically
calculated [51, 60].
There are in total three non-trivial cases of PT - and
APT -symmetric double-driven models, whereby nontrivial, we mean models with both stable and unstable re-

gions, characterized by real and complex-conjugate Floquet quasi-energies, respectively. In the following paragraphs, we will explore the salient features of each nontrivial case.
A.

PT -symmetric Models

Without loss of generality, we consider PT -symmetric
models where A is in the x-y plane while B is along the
z-axis. There are many different ways one could implement the double driving, and we start with the following
cosineY-cosineZ driven model,
H (t) = JX + γ {cos (ωt) Y − i cos (βωt) Z} ,

(1)

where an integer β ≥ 1 denotes that the gain-loss term
oscillates faster than the Hermitian term. In the following, we use J = 1 to set the energy scale, thereby using
γ ≡ γ/J and ω ≡ ω/J to denote the dimensionless amplitude and frequency of the Floquet drive. For analytical
calculations, we replace the cosine with a step function
taking values ±1, thereby creating a sequence of constant
Hamiltonians H` for the 1 ≤ ` ≤ 4β equal intervals that
span the period T . The piecewise constant Hamiltonians
are given by
H` = JX + γ (vy · l) Y − iγ (vz · l) Z,

`th entry

Taking Hamiltonian (1) and utilizing Floquet theory,
we are able to transform our time-dependent problem
into an effective time-independent one in which we can
find the Floquet quasi-energies, and then obtain their
phase diagrams. Constructing the corresponding piecewise version of the driven model (2) allows for analytical
calculations to find the phase boundaries or more commonly known as the exceptional lines, dividing unbroken
(stable) and broken (unstable) PT -symmetric regions. In
the analytical approach, we parametrize the 2×2 Floquet
Hamiltonian as HF = F nF · σ where α = ±F denote
the two Floquet quasienergies, nF is a unit vector, and
the single-period time evolution operator is given by
G(T ) =

(7)

Under this parametrization, the reality of Floquet eigenvalues, which is also the requirement for stability, is
equivalent to |cos (4βF τ )| ≤ 1. The EP contours, thus,
are given by cos (4βF τ ) = ±1.

FIG. 1: Stability of doubly-driven non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with β = 3. (a) Plot of max =α in the parameter
space of ω and γ for Hamiltonian (1) shows stable deep-blue regions punctuated by unstable regions at γ  1 at
specific frequencies. The resonance at ω = 2J/β is clearly seen. (b) EP contours obtained from G(T ) for the
piecewise constant Hamiltonian (2) also show qualitatively similar features, particularly at small γ values. Note that
stable regions at large gain-loss strengths γ  1 are more robust for the piecewise constant Hamiltonian, Eq.(2),
than its continuous counterpart, Eq.(1).

Figure 1 shows the representative results of such analysis. The left-hand panel, plotting the maximum imaginary part of Floquet quasi-energies max =α (ω, γ) for
β = 3, shows deep-blue stable regions (max =α = 0) at
small gain-loss strengths, punctuated by unstable, PT symmetry broken regions (max =α 6= 0) that occur at
vanishingly small γ when the modulation frequency ω
takes specific values. We also see thin slivers of stable regions that extend to arbitrarily large gain-loss strengths
γ  1. These results are obtained from an 82 × 82
truncated-matrix HF (ω1 , ω2 ) but remain the same when
the matrix size is doubled, thereby confirming that the
results are valid in the infinite-Floquet-matrix limit. The
right-hand panel shows the EP contours that are obtained from the analytical constraint | cos(F T )| = 1. It
is clear that the structure of the EPs in the γ  1 region
near the primary resonance ω = 2J/β = 2/3 is identical, as is the emergence of many other resonances at
low frequencies. On the other hand, the structure of the
EP contours at moderate to large values of γ is different,
although its salient features — such as the existence of
PT -symmetric, stable regions at arbitrarily large values
of γ— are retained by the analytically tractable model.
Similar results are obtained for other integer values of β,
and the phase diagram remains qualitatively similar for
rational βs as well.
Note that the primary resonance, where unstable regions emerge at vanishingly small gain-loss strength,
comes from the anti-Hermitian drive in Eq.(1). Our

subsequent APT -symmetric models have two antiHermitian drives and we will observe two primary resonances, one from each drive. This is a distinguishing
feature of systems with different frequency drives. It is
also important to point out that when β = 1, the timedependent part of the Hamiltonian (1) is proportional
to (Y − iZ). Since the matrix Y − iZ is defective, i.e.
it has doubly-degenerate zero eigenvalue with only one
eigevector, the eigenvalues of the corresponding Floquet
Hamiltonian, with the static JX term, are always real.
The non-trivial phase diagram, seen in Fig. 1 arises only
when β 6= 1.
B.

APT -symmetric Models

Next, we consider two non-trivial models that are best
thought of as APT symmetric, because they have two
anti-Hermitian drives and a constant Hermitian term.
We call them cosineX-cosineY and cosineX-sineY models. The sinusoidally varying Hamiltonians for the two
cases are given by
Hcc (t) = iγ {cos (ωt) X + cos (βωt) Y } + JZ,
Hcs (t) = iγ {cos (ωt) X + sin (βωt) Y } + JZ.

As before, the analysis of the frequency-domain, truncated Floquet Hamiltonian HF (ω1 , ω2 ) is supplemented
by analytical calculations using piecewise constant
Hamiltonians Hl = iγ {(vx · l)X + (vy · l)Y }+JZ. Here,

Figure 2 shows representative results of such analysis
for the Hamiltonian (8) with β = 3. The left-hand panel
shows that max =α is zero at small γ  1 except for
the triangular regions of instability (max =α > 0) that
arise near resonances ω = 2J, ω = 2J/β, and its lower
subharmonics. We also note, in contrast to the two-drive
PT -symmetric case, there are no regions of stability, with
real Floquet eigenvalues, at large γ  1. The right-hand
panel in Fig. 2 shows the corresponding analytical EP
contours, thereby confirming the salient, common features of cosineX-cosineY APT -symmetric Hamiltonian.
We note that a perturbation theory approach at small γ
near the resonances can be used to obtain the slopes and
corrections-to-linearity of the triangular unstable regions
seen in Fig. 2 [46, 47].

FIG. 3: Stability of cosineX-sineY Hamiltonian, Eq.(9)
with β = 3. (a) max =α (γ, ω) shows a large triangular
unstable region near ω = 2 and a small sliver near
ω = 2/β, along with their subharmonics. (b)
Corresponding EP contours from piecewise-constant
Hamiltonian show same qualitative features. The
clustering of EP contours at low frequencies ω  1 to
the static threshold γEP = 1 is also clear.

III. BERRY PHASES UNDER
NON-HERMITIAN, CYCLIC DYNAMICS

In Hermitian systems, when the single-drive Rabi problem is generalized to two drives, the system Hamiltonian
traces out a closed, two-dimensional loop in the parameter space. Berry phases result from the adiabatic evolution of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian on a closed cycle
in the parameter space. The standard Berry-phase expression for Hermitian Hamiltonians is given by
Z T

θBα = i

FIG. 2: Stability of cosineX-cosineY APT -symmetric
Hamiltonian, Eq.(8) with β = 3. (a) max =α (γ, ω)
shows triangular unstable regions near resonances
ω = 2, 2/β and their subharmonics. (b) Corresponding
EP contours from piecewise-constant Hamiltonian show
same qualitative features, including the absence of
stable regions at large gain-loss strengths.
Results for the cosineX-sineY model, Eq.(9), are shown
in Fig. 3. As in the previous cases, the stable regions,
indicated by max =α = 0 are seen at small gain-loss
strengths except in the vicinity of primary resonance at
ω = 2J. The key features of the stability diagram are
shared by the EP contours obtained from the piecewiseconstant Hamiltonian model. In addition to the large,
stable region at high frequencies and moderate gain-loss

where the Hamiltonian H(s) = H(s + T ) has eigenstates
|ψα (s)i with eigenvalues α (s), and Eq.(14) is valid as
long the time T is much longer than inverse of the smallest energy gap min |m (s) − n (s)| [57–59]. Due to the
unitary evolution generated by H, the eigenstates remain normalized, ∂s hψα (s)|ψα (s)i = 0, and therefore the
Berry phase defined in Eq.(14) is a real number.
One interesting feature of doubly-driven nonHermitian, Floquet models compared with single-driven
ones is that we are now able to investigate the analog
of Berry phases under cyclic evolution. Due to left- and
right-eigenvectors that are not related by Hermitian
conjugation, non-orthogonality of the (left) eigenstates
of H(s), the presence of EPs where the minimum energy
gap vanishes, and the chiral mode switch that such
systems undergo during cyclic evolution [50, 52], the
notion of Berry phases can be defined in several different
ways. We use the biorthogonal approach, where the

Berry phase for an eigenstate is defined by

where |ψLα i and |ψRα i denote the biorthonormalized
left- and right-eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H(s) with
eigenvalue α [61–64]. Since the two are not related by
Hermitian conjugation, hψL | 6= |ψR i† , the quantity defined by Eq.(15) is a complex number, in general.
First, we consider the PT -symmetric, cosineY-sineZ
model with the Hamiltonian

As in the past, we use J = 1 as the relevant energy
scale, and therefore γ ≡ γ/J denotes the dimensionless
strength of the sinusoidal modulation. The top panel
in Fig. 4 shows the dependence of the complex Berry
phase obtained from Eq.(15) as a function of γ at β = 1.
Note that the instantaneous eigenvalues of H(s), Eq.(16)

p
are given by ± J 2 + γ 2 cos (4πs/T ), and are therefore
purely real when |γ|/J ≤ 1. In contrast, for |γ| > J,
the instantaneous eigenvalues become complex-conjugate
pairs near s = T /4, 3T /4. The bottom panel in Fig. 4
shows the corresponding results for the complex Berry
phase when β = 3. We see that although the behavior at
large |γ/J|  1 is the same in both double-drive cases,
details at moderate values of |γ/J| ∼ O(1) are different.
Lastly, we consider an APT -symmetric model with
two anti-Hermitian drives,

When the drives are of the same frequency, β = 1, the
instantaneous spectrum of Eq.(17) is real for |γ|/J ≤ 1
while at larger drive strengths, |γ|/J > 1 the eigenvalues
are complex conjugates. The top panel in Fig. 5 shows
the real and imaginary parts of the complex Berry phase
across the threshold γc = ±1 when β = 1. In this case,
the anti-Hermitian drives sweep a circle and therefore
we find that the real part of the Berry phase is fixed

In this paper, we have analyzed the stability of several PT and APT -symmetric, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with different periodicities. We determined the
stable and unstable regions using frequency-domain Floquet Hamiltonians for sinusoidal variations, and comple-

mented the analysis by analytical determination of the
EP contours by using piecewise constant Hamiltonians.
Compared with single-drive models, we observe richer
dynamics and have more control over the regions of broken PT -symmetry. There are in total only three arrangements of drives with non-trivial Floquet quasi-energies.
Although the phase diagrams of Floquet quasi-energies
obtained have a lot of similarities with single driving,
there are some novel properties. A particular property
that emerges when we have driving with different frequencies, is the additional observation of the interlacing
of wisps or resonances of the two different frequencies
of drives. When we introduce a Hermitian drive into
an anti-Hermitian driven system, wisps from the phase
diagram do not merge at finite driving strength, γ. Furthermore, by studying the Berry phases arising from adiabatic cyclic evolution, we find complex structures with
non-Hermitian models. Non-Hermiticity brings about an
imaginary part to the Berry phases, and in different regions of the Hamiltonian’s instantaneous eigenvalues, the
behavior of the complex Berry phase for PT -symmetric
and APT -symmetric models is markedly different.
We can classify our models into two categories. All
our models have a static Hermitian term and we complement it either with two anti-Hermitian or one Hermitian plus one anti-Hermitian periodic driving. The
latter is experimentally more easily implemented, particularly in the semiclassical or quantum platforms where
both gain-loss Z-drive and the Hermitian Y-drive are tunable [31, 32, 35, 49, 50, 52]. The former, corresponding
to gain-loss Y and Z drives, is challenging: the first one
corresponds to Hatano-Nelson model [65] while the second one corresponds to the “standard” gain-loss dimer
case. However, non-Hermitian Floquet engineering offers a way to implement both Y and Z anti-Hermitian
drives [51].
A straightforward extension of this work entails replacing the Pauli operators by higher-dimensional representations of SU(2) [66, 67]. In the static and single-drive Floquet problems, this replacement does not qualitatively
change the Floquet results, except that the degree of EPs
— the number of eigenmodes that coalesce together at
the degeneracy — is given by the dimensionality of the
representation. Other possible extensions include irrational values of β where the total Hamiltonian H(t) is
only quasi-periodic.
