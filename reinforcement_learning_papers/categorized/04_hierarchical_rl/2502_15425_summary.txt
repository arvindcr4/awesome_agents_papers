**TITLE:** TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2502.15425v4
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 04_hierarchical_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces a decentralized framework for multi-agent hierarchical reinforcement learning, called TAG. TAG enables the construction of arbitrarily deep agent hierarchies, where each level perceives and interacts only with the level directly below it. The framework uses a LevelEnv abstraction, which transforms each hierarchical layer into an environment for the agents above it.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* TAG enables the construction of arbitrarily deep agent hierarchies, allowing for more complex and scalable multi-agent systems.
* The framework uses a LevelEnv abstraction, which standardizes information flow between levels while preserving agent autonomy.
* TAG supports heterogeneous agents across levels, allowing different learning algorithms to be deployed where most appropriate.
* The framework demonstrates improved performance and sample efficiency compared to traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines.
* TAG provides a flexible solution for multi-agent coordination, enabling the integration of diverse agent types and learning algorithms.
