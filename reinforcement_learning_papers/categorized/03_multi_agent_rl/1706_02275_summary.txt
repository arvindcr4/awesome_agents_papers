**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments
**ARXIV_ID:** 1706.02275v4
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a multi-agent policy gradient algorithm where agents learn a centralized critic based on the observations and actions of all agents. The algorithm, called Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), uses a centralized critic to estimate the expected return for each agent, and updates the policies using the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The paper proposes a new multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, MADDPG, which uses a centralized critic to estimate the expected return for each agent.
* The algorithm is applicable to both cooperative and competitive environments, and can handle complex multi-agent coordination tasks.
* The paper provides empirical results showing that MADDPG outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), in various multi-agent environments.
* The paper also introduces a method to improve the stability of multi-agent policies by training agents with an ensemble of policies, which leads to more robust multi-agent policies.
