Abstract
Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is
essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language
models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the
LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally
with the search engine. This paper introduces S EARCH -R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where
the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. S EARCH -R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions,
leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple
outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering
datasets show that S EARCH -R1 improves performance by 24% (Qwen2.57B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same
setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrievalaugmented reasoning. The code and model checkpoints are available at

Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding and generation (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2018). Despite
these achievements, LLMs often encounter challenges when tasked with complex reasoning
(Wei et al., 2022) and retrieving up-to-date information from external sources (Jin et al.,
2024). Addressing these limitations necessitates integrating advanced reasoning abilities
(Huang & Chang, 2022) and the capability to interact effectively with search engines to best
utilize external up-to-date information (Schick et al., 2023).
Existing approaches for integrating LLMs with search engines typically fall into two categories: (1) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Gao et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020)
and (2) treating the search engine as a tool (Yao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023). RAG
models often retrieve passages based on the LLM input as query and incorporate them
into the LLM’s context for generation (Lewis et al., 2020). This allows the LLM to leverage
external knowledge when answering questions. Although existing work (Trivedi et al.,
2022a) prompts LLM for multi-turn, multi-query retrieval, this approach is suboptimal
because the LLM is not optimized to learn how to interact effectively with search engines
during training. Alternatively, LLMs can be prompted or trained to utilize tools, including
search engines, as part of their reasoning process (Qu et al., 2025; Trivedi et al., 2022a).
However, prompting-based approaches often struggle to generalize, as certain tasks may
not have been encountered during LLM pretraining. On the other hand, training-based

approaches offer greater adaptability but are difficult to scale effectively due to their reliance
on large-scale, high-quality annotated trajectories and the inherent non-differentiability
of the search operation, which renders end-to-end gradient descent-based optimization
inapplicable (Schick et al., 2023; Asai et al., 2024).
Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton et al., 1999; Kaelbling et al., 1996) has emerged as a
potent paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Guo et al., 2025; Hou
et al., 2025; Xie et al., 2025; Kumar et al., 2024). Notably, models like OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al.,
2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) have leveraged RL techniques (e.g., PPO (Schulman
et al., 2017) and GRPO (Shao et al., 2024)) to improve logical inference and problem-solving
skills by learning from experience and feedback. With RL, even when trained solely on
the outcome rewards, the models learn complex reasoning capabilities, including selfverification (Weng et al., 2022) and self-correction (Kumar et al., 2024). However, applying
RL to search-and-reasoning scenarios presents three key challenges: (1) RL Framework and
Stability – It remains unclear how to effectively integrate the search engine into the RL
approaches for LLMs while ensuring stable optimization, particularly when incorporating
retrieved context. (2) Multi-Turn Interleaved Reasoning and Search – Ideally, the LLM
should be capable of iterative reasoning and search engine calls, dynamically adjusting the
retrieval strategy based on the complexity of the problem. (3) Reward Design – Designing
an effective reward function for search and reasoning tasks remains a fundamental challenge,
as it is unclear whether simple outcome-based rewards are sufficient to guide the LLM to
learn meaningful and consistent search behaviors.
To address aforementioned challenges, we introduce S EARCH -R1, a novel RL framework
that enables LLMs to interact with search engines in an interleaved manner with their own
reasoning. Specifically, S EARCH -R1 introduces the following key innovations: (1) We model
the search engine as part of the environment, enabling sampled trajectory sequences that
interleave LLM token generation with search engine retrievals. S EARCH -R1 is compatible
with various RL algorithms, including PPO and GRPO, and we apply retrieved token
masking to ensure stable optimization. (2) S EARCH -R1 supports multi-turn retrieval and
reasoning, invoking search calls when explicitly triggered by <search> and </search>
tokens. Retrieved content is enclosed within <information> and </information> tokens,
while LLM reasoning steps are wrapped within <think> and </think> tokens. The final
answer is formatted using <answer> and </answer> tokens, allowing for structured, iterative
decision-making. (3) We adopt a straightforward outcome-based reward function, avoiding
the complexity of process-based rewards. Our results demonstrate that this minimal reward
design is effective in search-and-reasoning scenarios. As such, S EARCH -R1 can be viewed as
an extension of DeepSeek-R1 Zero (Guo et al., 2025), which primarily focuses on parametric
reasoning by introducing search-augmented RL training for enhanced retrieval-driven
decision-making.
In summary, our key contributions are threefold:
• Our work analyzes the challenges and provides perspectives on implementing RL to
improve how LLMs reason using search engine results.

• We propose S EARCH -R1, a novel RL framework that supports LLM rollouts and direct
optimization with a search engine, including retrieved token masking to stabilize RL
training, multi-turn interleaved reasoning and search to support complex task-solving
and an effective outcome reward function.

• We conduct systematic experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of S EARCH -R1, with
two LLMs achieving respective average relative improvements of 41% and 20% over
RAG baselines under the same experimental setup (e.g., same retrieval model, training
data, and pre-trained LLMs). In addition, we provide insights on RL for reasoning and
search settings, including RL method selection, different LLM choices, and response
length study.

Large Language Models and Retrieval

Despite demonstrating remarkable reasoning (Guo et al., 2025) and coding (Guo et al., 2024)
capabilities, LLMs (Zhao et al., 2023; Team, 2024; Achiam et al., 2023) often lack domainspecific knowledge (Peng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023) and are prone to hallucinations (Zhang
et al., 2023). To mitigate these limitations, search engines (Zhao et al., 2024) are widely
integrated to supply external information. There are two primary ways to integrate search
engines with LLMs: (1) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Gao et al., 2023) and (2)
treating the search engines as tools (Schick et al., 2023). RAG (Lewis et al., 2020; Yue et al.,
2024; Xiong et al., 2025) typically follows a round of retrieval and sequential generation
pipelines, where a search engine fetches relevant information based on the input query,
which is then concatenated with the query and fed into the LLM. However, this could
face challenges of retrieving irrelevant information (Jin et al., 2024) and failing to provide
sufficiently useful context (Jiang et al., 2023). An alternative approach is search-as-a-tool,
where LLMs are prompted or fine-tuned to interact with search engines. IRCoT (Trivedi
et al., 2022a) and ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) use prompting to guide iterative reasoning and
search engine calls, while Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) leverages supervised fine-tuning to
enhance search capabilities. However, such methods rely on high-quality labeled trajectories,
which are difficult to obtain at scale. Recent work (Guo et al., 2025) suggests that RL can
enable LLMs to develop advanced reasoning skills using only outcome rewards, yet its
potential in search engine calling scenarios remains under-explored.
2.2

Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) (Kaelbling et al., 1996) is a learning paradigm where an agent
learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving
feedback in the form of rewards, aiming to maximize cumulative reward over time (Sutton
et al., 1999). RL was introduced to LLM tuning by Ouyang et al. (2022) through RL from
human feedback (RLHF) (Kaufmann et al., 2023). This approach first trains a reward model
using human preference data (Lambert et al., 2024), which then guides RL-based tuning of
the policy LLM, typically via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, PPO involves
multiple rounds of LLM optimization, making it challenging to implement. To simplify
RL-based tuning, direct optimization methods such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) and SimPO (Meng et al., 2024) have been proposed. A similar
approach is employed in LeRet (Hsu et al., 2024), where LLMs are trained to explore diverse
queries to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval. While these methods offer
computational efficiency, they suffer from off-policy issues (Pang et al., 2024) and do not
consistently match the performance of pure RL approaches. Alternative solutions include
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which eliminates the need for
a critic model by estimating baselines from group scores, and RLOO (Ahmadian et al., 2024),
which introduces a simplified REINFORCE-style (Williams, 1992) optimization framework.
Despite these advances, the application of RL to LLM-driven search engine interactions and
reasoning remains largely unexplored.

During the rollout, LLMs can conduct multi-turn interactions with the search engine.
where πθ is the policy LLM, πref is the reference LLM, rϕ is the reward function and DKL is
KL-divergence measure. x denote input samples drawn from the dataset D , and y represent
the generated outputs interleaved with search engine calling results, sampled from the
reference policy πref (y | x ) and retrieved from the search engine R. Unlike prior RL
approaches that primarily rely on the policy LLM πθ (· | x ) to generate rollout sequences
(Rafailov et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022), our framework explicitly incorporates
retrieval

interleaved reasoning via πθ (· | x; R), which can be seen as πθ (· | x ) R, where
denotes interleaved retrieval-and-reasoning. This enables more effective decision-making
in reasoning-intensive tasks that require external information retrieval. An illustration of
the rollout process and an explanation of Eq. 1 are provided in Section 3.2 and Appendix A.
Our approach builds upon two well-established policy gradient RL methods: Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2025), leveraging their respective advantages to
optimize retrieval-augmented reasoning.
Loss Masking for Retrieved Tokens. In both PPO and GRPO, the token-level losses are
computed over the entire rollout sequence. In S EARCH -R1, the rollout sequence consists of
both LLM-generated tokens and retrieved tokens from external passages. While optimizing
LLM-generated tokens enhances the model’s ability to interact with the search engine
and perform reasoning, applying the same optimization to retrieved tokens can lead to
unintended learning dynamics. To address this, we introduce loss masking for retrieved
tokens, ensuring the policy gradient objective is computed only over LLM-generated tokens,
excluding retrieved content from the optimization process. This approach stabilizes training
while preserving the flexibility of search-augmented generation.
PPO with Search Engine. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) is a
popular actor-critic RL approach commonly used for LLMs (Ouyang et al., 2022). For our
reasoning scenarios that involve search engine calling, it optimizes LLMs by maximizing
the following objective:

where πθ and πold represent the current and previous policy models, respectively. I (yt )
is the token loss masking operation such that I (yt ) = 1 if yt is a LLM generated token
and I (yt ) = 0 if yt is a retrieved token. The term ϵ is a clipping-related hyperparameter
introduced in PPO to stabilize training. The advantage estimate At is computed using
Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2015), based on future rewards
{r≥t } and a learned value function Vϕ .

GRPO with Search Engine. To improve policy optimization stability and avoid the need
for an additional value function approximation, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is introduced in Shao et al. (2024). GRPO differs from PPO by leveraging the average reward
of multiple sampled outputs as a baseline rather than relying on a learned value function.
Specifically, for each input question x, GRPO samples a group of responses {y1 , y2 , . . . , yG }
from the reference policy πref . The policy model is then optimized by maximizing the
following objective function:

(3)

where ϵ and β are hyperparameters, and Âi,t represent the advantage, computed based
on the relative rewards of outputs within each group. This approach avoids introducing
additional complexity in the computation of Âi,t . Additionally, instead of incorporating KL
divergence as a penalty within the reward function, GRPO regularizes by directly adding
the KL divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy to the loss function.
The retrieved token masking is also applied when calculating the KL divergence loss DKL .
3.2

Generation with Multi-turn Search Engine Calling

In this section, we describe the rollout process for LLM response generation N
with interleaved
multi-turn search engine calls, formulated as: y ∼ πθ (· | x; R) = πθ (· | x ) R.
Our approach follows an iterative framework where the LLM alternates between text
generation and external search engine queries. Specifically, the system instruction guides
the LLM to encapsulate its search query between two designated search call tokens, <search>
and </search>, whenever an external retrieval is needed. Upon detecting these tokens in
the generated sequence, the system extracts the search query, queries the search engine, and
retrieves relevant results. The retrieved information is then enclosed within special retrieval
tokens, <information> and </information>, and appended to the ongoing rollout sequence,
serving as additional context for the next generation step. This process continues iteratively
until one of the following conditions is met: (1) the maximum number of action is reached,
or (2) the model generates a final response, which is enclosed between designated answer
tokens, <answer> and </answer>. The complete workflow is outlined in Algorithm 1.
3.3

Training Template

To train S EARCH -R1, we start by crafting a simple template that directs the initial LLM
to follow our predefined instructions. As shown in Table 1, this template structures the
model’s output into three parts in an iterative fashion: first, a reasoning process, then a
search engine calling function, and finally, the answer. We deliberately limit our constraints
to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biases, such as enforcing reflective
reasoning and search engine calling or endorsing specific problem-solving approaches.
This ensures that the model’s natural learning dynamics during the RL process remain
observable and unbiased.
Answer the given question. You must conduct reasoning inside <think> and </think>
first every time you get new information. After reasoning, if you find you lack some
knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search>, and it will
return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You
can search as many times as you want. If you find no further external knowledge
needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer> without
detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> xxx </answer>. Question: question.

3.4

Reward Modeling

The reward function serves as the primary training signal, guiding the optimization process
in RL. To train S EARCH -R1, we adopt a rule-based reward system that consists solely of
final outcome rewards, which assess the correctness of the model’s response. For instance,
in factual reasoning tasks, correctness can be evaluated using rule-based criteria such as
exact string matching:
rϕ ( x, y) = EM( apred , agold ),

(4)

where apred is the extracted final answer from response y and agold is the ground truth
answer. Unlike Guo et al. (2025), we do not incorporate format rewards, as our learned
model already demonstrates strong structural adherence. We leave the exploration of more
complex format rewards for future work. Furthermore, we avoid training neural reward
models, following Guo et al. (2025). This decision is motivated by the sensitivity of LLMs to
specific forms of rewards in large-scale RL, as well as the additional computational cost and
complexity introduced by retraining these models.

Main Results

4.1

Datasets

We evaluate S EARCH -R1 on seven benchmark datasets, categorized as follows: (1) General
Question Answering: NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and
PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022). (2) Multi-Hop Question Answering: HotpotQA (Yang et al.,
2018), 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), Musique (Trivedi et al., 2022b), and Bamboogle
(Press et al., 2022). These datasets encompass a diverse range of search with reasoning
challenges, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of S EARCH -R1.

4.2

Baselines

To evaluate the effectiveness of S EARCH -R1, we compare it against the following baselines:
(1) Inference without Retrieval: Direct inference and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
(Wei et al., 2022). (2) Inference with Retrieval: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
(Lewis et al., 2020), IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2022a), and Search-o1 (Li et al., 2025). (3) FineTuning-Based Methods: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Chung et al., 2024), RL-based finetuning without a search engine (R1) (Guo et al., 2025) and rejection sampling (Ahn et al.,
2024) with a search engine. For R1, we train the LLMs with the RL methods proposed in
Guo et al. (2025) with our data to have a fair comparison with S EARCH -R1. It only contains
reasoning and answer steps without a search engine. For rejection sampling, we generate
five candidate responses per training prompt from the same dataset with the instructed
LLMs and select those that lead to correct final answers. These selected trajectories are then
used to construct a new training set that retains the same multi-turn LLM–search engine
interaction rollout mechanism proposed in S EARCH -R1 to fine-tune the LLMs.
These baselines cover a broad spectrum of retrieval-augmented and fine-tuning approaches,
allowing for a comprehensive assessment of S EARCH -R1 in both zero-shot and learned
retrieval settings. To make a fair comparison between different methods, we use the same
retriever, same number of retrieved documents, same knowledge corpus, same training
data and same pre-trained LLMs. Details can be found in Appendix B.
4.3

Experimental Setup

We conduct experiments using two types of models: Qwen-2.5-3B (Base/Instruct) and
Qwen-2.5-7B (Base/Instruct) (Yang et al., 2024). For retrieval, we use the 2018 Wikipedia
dump (Karpukhin et al., 2020) as the knowledge source and E5 (Wang et al., 2022) as
the retriever. To ensure fair comparison, we follow Lin et al. (2023) and set the number
of retrieved passages to 3 across all retrieval-based methods. A study of the number of
retrieved passages can be found in Appendix G.
For training, we merge the training sets of NQ and HotpotQA to form a unified dataset for
S EARCH -R1 and other fine-tuning based baselines. Evaluation is conducted on the test or
validation sets of seven datasets to assess both in-domain and out-of-domain performance.
Exact Match (EM) is used as the evaluation metric, following Yu et al. (2024). For inferencestyle baselines, we use instruct models, as base models fail to follow instructions. For RL
tuning methods, experiments are conducted on both base and instruct models. More details
on experimental settings can be found in Appendix B.
Unless stated otherwise, PPO is used as the default RL method, and a detailed comparison
between PPO and GRPO is provided in Section 5.1.
4.4

Performance

The main results comparing S EARCH -R1 with baseline methods across the seven datasets
are presented in Table 2. From the results, we make the following key observations: (1)
S EARCH -R1 consistently outperforms strong baseline methods. We achieve 24% and 20%
average relative improvement with Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B, respectively. These gains
hold across both in-distribution evaluation (i.e., NQ and HotpotQA) and out-of-distribution
evaluation (i.e., TriviaQA, PopQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, Musique, and Bamboogle). (2)
S EARCH -R1 surpasses RL-based training for LLM reasoning without retrieval (R1). This
aligns with expectations, as incorporating search into LLM reasoning provides access to
relevant external knowledge, improving overall performance. (3) S EARCH -R1 is effective
for both base and instruction-tuned models. This demonstrates that DeepSeek-R1-Zerostyle RL with outcome-based rewards (Guo et al., 2025) can be successfully applied to
reasoning with search, extending beyond its previously established effectiveness in pure
reasoning scenarios. (4) Larger models are better on learning how to do search. S EARCH R1 on 7B model shows much larger “performance gap” compared with 3B model (e.g.,
compared with second best model - RAG).

Analysis

5.1

Different RL methods: PPO vs. GRPO

We evaluate S EARCH -R1 using both PPO and GRPO as the base RL method, conducting
experiments on Qwen2.5-3B/7B models. The training dynamics comparison is presented
in Figure 2(a) and the evaluation results are presented in Table 3, revealing the following
insights: (1) GRPO converges faster than PPO across all cases. This is because PPO relies
on a critic model, which requires several warm-up steps before effective training begins.
(2) PPO demonstrates greater training stability. As shown in Figure 2(a), GRPO leads to
reward collapse after training for many steps, whereas PPO remains stable. (3) The final
training rewards of PPO and GRPO are comparable. Despite differences in convergence
speed and stability, both methods achieve similar final train reward and performance,
indicating that both are viable for optimizing S EARCH -R1. PPO exhibits greater training
stability, making it a preferable choice in this setting. More results are in Appendix F.

Base vs. Instruct LLMs

We analyze the training dynamics of S EARCH -R1 across both base LLMs and instructiontuned LLMs. Experiments are conducted on two model variants: Qwen2.5-3B, and Qwen2.57B. As shown in Figure 2(b), we observe that instruction-tuned models converge faster and
start from a higher initial performance compared to base models. However, the final training
reward of both model types remains highly similar after training. This finding suggests
that while general post-training accelerates learning in reasoning-plus-search scenarios,
RL can effectively bridge the gap over time, enabling base models to achieve comparable
performance. More results can be found in Appendix E.
5.3

Response Length and Valid Search Study

We conduct an experiment using S EARCH -R1 with the Qwen2.5-7b-base model to analyze
the dynamics of response length and number of valid search engine calls over the course
of training. The response length result is presented in Figure 2(c), revealing the following
key trends: (1) Early Stage (First 100 Steps): The response length sharply decreases, while
the training reward exhibits a slight increase. During this phase, the base model learns to
eliminate excessive filler words and begins adapting to the task requirements. (2) Later Stage
(After 100 Steps): Both response length and training reward increase significantly. At this
point, the LLM learns to call the search engine frequently, resulting in longer responses due
to retrieved passages. The training reward improves substantially, as the model becomes
more effective at leveraging search results. The valid search result is presented in Figure 2(d),
showing that the LLMs learn to call the search engine more times as the training proceeds.
5.4

Study of Retrieved Tokens Loss Masking

In Section 3.1, we introduced loss masking for retrieved tokens to prevent unintended
optimization behaviors. Here, we conduct experiments on the Qwen2.5-7b-base model,
comparing training dynamics with and without retrieved token loss masking. As shown in
Figure 3, applying retrieved token masking results in greater LLM improvements, mitigating
unintended optimization effects and ensuring more stable training. The performance
comparison is provided in Table 4, demonstrating that S EARCH -R1 trained with retrieved
token loss masking consistently outperforms the variant without masking.

Conclusions

In this work, we introduced S EARCH -R1, a novel RL framework that enables LLMs to
interleave self-reasoning with real-time search engine interactions. Unlike existing RAGlike approaches, which relies on extensive prompting for multi-turn retrieval, or tool-use
methods that require large-scale supervised training data, S EARCH -R1 optimizes LLM
rollouts through RL, allowing autonomous query generation and strategic utilization of
retrieved information. Through extensive experiments on seven datasets, we demonstrated
that S EARCH -R1 significantly enhances LLMs’ ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks
requiring real-time external knowledge. Our analysis also provides key insights into RL
training strategies for search-augmented reasoning. Looking ahead, future work can explore
expanding S EARCH -R1 to support broader search strategies, including more sophisticated
reward mechanisms, dynamic retrieval adjustments based on uncertainty, combining with
diverse set of tools and integration with diverse information sources beyond search. It is
also promising to investigate its applicability to multimodal reasoning tasks.

Appendix
A

Formulation of Reinforcement Learning with a Search Engine

The classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework for training large language models
(LLMs) can be formulated as follows (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022):


max Ex∼D,y∼πθ (·| x) rϕ ( x, y) − βDKL [πθ (y | x ) || πref (y | x )] ,
(5)
πθ

where x denotes a prompt sampled from a dataset D , y is a response generated by the
policy model πθ , and πref represents a reference model that serves as a regularization anchor.
The reward function rϕ ( x, y) quantifies the quality of the generated response, while the
KL divergence term constrains the updated policy to remain close to the reference model,
thereby promoting training stability.
However, this formulation assumes that the entire output sequence y is generated solely
by the policy LLM. This assumption does not hold in our setting, where model behavior
incorporates both internal reasoning and external information retrieval. To accommodate
this, we extend the RL objective to incorporate an external search engine R, yielding the
following formulation:


max Ex∼D,y∼πθ (·| x;R) rϕ ( x, y) − βDKL [πθ (y | x; R) || πref (y | x; R)] ,
(6)
πθ

In this revised objective, the trajectory y ∼ πθ (· | x; R) includes interleaved reasoning steps
and retrieved content, reflecting a multi-turn interaction between the LLM and the search
engine. The KL divergence is computed over the joint response distribution conditioned on
both the prompt and the retrieval-augmented context, ensuring the learned policy remains
aligned with the reference model even in the presence of external information.

Experimental Setups

B.1

Baselines

Several recent works have explored RAG pipelines, particularly in benchmarks such as
Natural Questions (NQ) or HotpotQA, aiming to improve performance through more
elaborate retrieval mechanisms. For instance, Re2G (Glass et al., 2022) and RetroLLM (Li
et al., 2024) propose sophisticated retrieve-rerank-generate frameworks that employ strong
retrievers and complex reranking strategies to select fine-grained evidence for generation.
While these approaches demonstrate impressive results, they often rely on task-specific
engineering or heavyweight pipelines that limit generalizability and scalability. In contrast,
our focus is on a more lightweight and general approach to retrieval-augmented reasoning.
As such, we do not include these methods as direct baselines, though they represent valuable
directions in the broader space of retrieval-enhanced language modeling.
B.2

Experimental Settings

We conduct experiments using two types of models: Qwen-2.5-3B (Base/Instruct) and
Qwen-2.5-7B (Base/Instruct) (Yang et al., 2024). For retrieval, we use the 2018 Wikipedia
dump (Karpukhin et al., 2020) as the knowledge source and E5 (Wang et al., 2022) as the
retriever. To ensure fair comparison, we follow Lin et al. (2023) and set the number of
retrieved passages to 3 across all retrieval-based methods.
For training, we merge the training sets of NQ and HotpotQA to form a unified dataset for
S EARCH -R1 and other fine-tuning based baselines. Evaluation is conducted on the test or
validation sets of seven datasets to assess both in-domain and out-of-domain performance.
Exact Match (EM) is used as the evaluation metric, following Yu et al. (2024). For inferencestyle baselines, we use instruct models, as base models fail to follow instructions. For RL
tuning methods, experiments are conducted on both base and instruct models. More details
on experimental settings can be found in Appendix B.

Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025

For the PPO variant of S EARCH -R1, we set the learning rate of the policy LLM to 1e-6
and that of the value LLM to 1e-5. Training is conducted for 500 steps, with warm-up
ratios of 0.285 and 0.015 for the policy and value models, respectively. We use Generalized
Advantage Estimation (GAE) with parameters λ = 1 and γ = 1.
Training is performed on a single node with 8 H100 GPUs. We use a total batch size of
512, with a mini-batch size of 256 and a micro-batch size of 64. The maximum sequence
length is set to 4,096 tokens, with a maximum response length of 500 and a maximum length
of 500 tokens for retrieved content. To optimize GPU memory usage, we enable gradient
checkpointing and use Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) with CPU offloading.
For efficient LLM rollouts, we adopt vLLM1 with a tensor parallel size of 1 and GPU memory
utilization ratio of 0.6. The rollout sampling uses a temperature of 1.0 and a top-p value of
1.0. The KL divergence regularization coefficient β and clip ratio ϵ are set to 0.001 and 0.2.
For GRPO training, we set the policy LLM learning rate to 1e-6 and sample 5 responses per
prompt, following the GRPO implementation in Verl (Sheng et al., 2024)2 . The model is
trained for 500 steps with a learning rate warm-up ratio of 0.285. Training is conducted on
the same 8×H100 setup with identical batch sizes and sequence length configurations as in
PPO.
We also use gradient checkpointing, FSDP offloading, and vLLM-based rollouts with the
same hyperparameters as above. The rollout temperature and top-p values are both set to
1.0, and the KL divergence coefficient β and clip ratio ϵ are fixed at 0.001 and 0.2.
For both methods, model checkpoints are saved every 100 steps. In cases where training
diverges, we evaluate at the most recent stable checkpoint according to the training reward
curve; otherwise, the final checkpoint is used for evaluation. The maximum action budget
B is set to 4, and we retrieve the top 3 passages by default.
We compute outcome rewards using exact match (EM). Unless otherwise noted, PPO is
used as the default RL algorithm, and a detailed comparison with GRPO is provided in
Section 5.1.

Main Results on 14B LLM

We conduct extensive experiments using the Qwen2.5-14B models, and the results are
presented in Table 5. As shown, S EARCH -R1 consistently outperforms all baseline methods
across the evaluated metrics. Furthermore, we observe that increasing the model size leads
to consistent performance gains with S EARCH -R1, highlighting the benefits of LLM size
scaling in our approach.

D

Retrieved Token Loss Masking Study

In Section 3.1, we introduced a loss masking strategy for retrieved tokens to mitigate
undesirable optimization behaviors during training. To evaluate its impact, we conduct
experiments using the Qwen2.5-3b/7b-base model, comparing training dynamics with
and without retrieved token loss masking. As illustrated in Figure 3, incorporating the
masking mechanism leads to more stable optimization and improved model performance.
Quantitative results in Table 6 further confirm that S EARCH -R1, when trained with loss
masking on retrieved tokens, consistently outperforms its unmasked counterpart.

E

Base vs. Instruct LLMs

We investigate the training dynamics of S EARCH -R1 across both base and instruction-tuned
LLMs, using two model scales: Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B. As depicted in Figure 4,

instruction-tuned models exhibit faster convergence and benefit from higher initial performance relative to their base counterparts. Despite this early advantage, the final performance
of both model types converges to a similar level after training. These results indicate that
while instruction tuning facilitates more efficient early-stage learning in reasoning-plussearch tasks, reinforcement learning is capable of closing the performance gap, ultimately
enabling base models to reach comparable outcomes.

that PPO relies on a separate value function (critic), which requires an initial warm-up
phase before effective policy updates can be made. (2) PPO provides more stable training
behavior, as evidenced in Figure 5, where GRPO encounters reward collapse over extended
training steps, whereas PPO maintains stability throughout. (3) PPO and GRPO achieve
comparable final reward performance, suggesting that despite trade-offs in convergence
speed and stability, both methods are effective for optimizing S EARCH -R1.

Number of Retrieved Passages Study in S EARCH -R1 Training

We investigate the impact of the number of retrieved passages (top-k) on the training
dynamics of S EARCH -R1. While our main experiments adopt top-k = 3 following Lin et al.
(2023), we conduct additional studies with top-k set to 1, 3, and 5 to better understand its
influence.
Figure 6 presents the training reward curves under these settings. We observe that all three
configurations exhibit similar overall training trajectories. Notably, top-k = 5 achieves the
fastest initial convergence, reaching the highest training reward within the first 200 steps.
However, its reward gradually declines and becomes more unstable as training progresses.
In contrast, top-k = 1 and 3 demonstrate more consistent improvements throughout training,
with top-k = 3 ultimately achieving the highest reward after 500 steps.
Evaluation results at step 500 are summarized in Table 7, where top-k = 3 yields the best
overall performance. We hypothesize two contributing factors: (1) top-k = 1 likely suffers
from low retrieval recall, limiting the ability to provide relevant contextual information; (2)
top-k = 5 introduces lower precision due to the inclusion of noisy or irrelevant passages (Jin
et al., 2024), which not only degrades inference performance but may also adversely affect
RL training—discouraging the model from leveraging retrieved content when it learns that
the additional context is often unhelpful or misleading.

Group Size Study in S EARCH -R1 (GRPO) Training

In our main experiment, we set the group size for S EARCH -R1 (GRPO) to 5, following the
setting in Sheng et al. (2024). To further investigate the impact of group size on training
dynamics, we conduct an ablation study with group sizes of 1, 3, and 5. Notably, when
the group size is set to 1, GRPO reduces to the standard REINFORCE algorithm (Williams,
1992).
We train the LLMs for 500 steps, saving model checkpoints every 100 steps. If the model
collapses during training, we use the last valid checkpoint for evaluation; otherwise, we
evaluate the checkpoint at step 500.
The training dynamics under different group size configurations are illustrated in Figure 7.
We observe that a larger group size generally leads to faster convergence but may also
increase the risk of collapse due to the inherent instability of reinforcement learning.
Evaluation results across different settings are summarized in Table 8. While larger group
sizes can accelerate convergence and achieve higher training rewards, smaller group sizes
(e.g., size = 1) enable more stable training and better generalization. This is reflected in
superior performance on unseen tasks, highlighting a trade-off between learning speed and
stability in GRPO training.

To gain deeper insights into S EARCH -R1, we conduct a case study using Qwen2.5-7B-Base,
comparing its behavior with RL without a search engine (Guo et al., 2025). The results are
presented in Table 20, revealing the following key observations:
20

Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025

Interleaved Reasoning and Retrieval Enhances Problem Analysis: S EARCH -R1 enables
the LLM to perform in-depth reasoning with multi-turn retrieval, whereas RL without
search relies solely on the models’ internal knowledge. By incorporating retrieved passages,
S EARCH -R1 allows the LLM to iteratively refine its reasoning, leading to more informed
and accurate responses.
Self-Verification through Iterative Retrieval: We observe that after the second retrieval
round, the LLM has already gathered sufficient information to answer the question. However, S EARCH -R1 performs an additional retrieval step to self-verify its conclusion, further
reinforcing its confidence in the final response. This phenomenon aligns with findings from
LLM reasoning RL without retrieval (Guo et al., 2025), highlighting how RL can encourage
verification-driven reasoning even in search-augmented settings.
