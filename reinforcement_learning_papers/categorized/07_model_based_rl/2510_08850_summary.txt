**TITLE:** Repository-Aware File Path Retrieval via Fine-Tuned LLMs
**ARXIV_ID:** Not provided
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl (although the paper is more focused on natural language processing and information retrieval)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a new approach to file path retrieval in code repositories by fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to directly predict relevant file paths given a natural language query. The model is trained on a dataset generated using six complementary strategies, each focusing on a different view of the code. The approach combines the strengths of LLMs (understanding natural language and complex questions) with a targeted retrieval objective.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Proposed a new approach to file path retrieval in code repositories using fine-tuned LLMs
* Developed a dataset generation pipeline using six complementary strategies to cover multiple granularities of questions
* Demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach on several repositories, including small to medium-sized projects and a large project (PyTorch)
* Showed that the fine-tuned model can achieve high retrieval accuracy on small to medium-sized repositories and decent accuracy on a large repository
* Highlighted the importance of diverse training data and careful prompt design in fine-tuning LLMs for repository-specific tasks
