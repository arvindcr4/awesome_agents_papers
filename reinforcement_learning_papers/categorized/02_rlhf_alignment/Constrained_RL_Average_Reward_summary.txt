**TITLE:** Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Average Reward Objective: Model-Based and Model-Free Algorithms
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper presents model-based and model-free approaches for constrained reinforcement learning (RL) with an average reward objective. The model-based approach involves learning the optimal policy by creating a good estimate of the state-transition function of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP). The model-free approach, on the other hand, directly estimates the policy function or maintains an estimate of the Q-function, which is subsequently used for policy generation.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The paper provides a comprehensive study of constrained RL with an average reward objective, including both model-based and model-free approaches.
* It presents two model-based algorithms: Optimism-Based Reinforcement Learning (C-UCRL) and Model-Based Posterior Sampling Algorithm.
* The paper also discusses the regret analysis and constraint violation for the proposed algorithms, providing bounds on the objective regret and constraint violation.
* The authors extend their discussion to encompass results tailored for weakly communicating MDPs, broadening the scope of their findings and their relevance to a wider range of practical scenarios.
