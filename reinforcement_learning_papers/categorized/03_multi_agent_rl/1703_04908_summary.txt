**PAPER**: Emergence of Grounded Compositional Language in Multi-Agent Populations
**TITLE**: Emergence of Grounded Compositional Language in Multi-Agent Populations
**ARXIV_ID**: 1703.04908v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about the emergence of a basic compositional language. The language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time and has a coherent structure with a defined vocabulary and syntax. The agents learn to communicate through reinforcement learning, where the goal is to maximize the expected shared return for all agents.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* Emergence of grounded compositional language in multi-agent populations
* Proposal of a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods
* Demonstration of the emergence of a basic compositional language with a coherent structure
* Investigation of the effect of variation in environment configuration and physical capabilities of agents on communication strategies
* Observation of non-verbal communication strategies, such as pointing and guiding, when language communication is unavailable
