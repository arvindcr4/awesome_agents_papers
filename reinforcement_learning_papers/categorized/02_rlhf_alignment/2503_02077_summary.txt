**TITLE:** M3 HF: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality

**ARXIV_ID:** 2503.02077v3

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback Alignment)

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a novel framework, M3 HF, for multi-agent reinforcement learning that incorporates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality. The framework extends the Markov Game to include human input and leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse and integrate human feedback. This approach enables agents to learn more effectively from human feedback, even when the feedback is of mixed quality.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Proposed a novel framework, M3 HF, for multi-agent reinforcement learning that incorporates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality.
* Extended the Markov Game to include human input and leveraged LLMs to parse and integrate human feedback.
* Demonstrated the effectiveness of M3 HF in various multi-agent environments, including Overcooked and Google Research Football.
* Showed that M3 HF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including IPPO and MAPPO, in terms of performance and scalability.
* Provided a theoretical analysis of the robustness of M3 HF to low-quality human feedback, demonstrating that the framework can mitigate the impact of unhelpful feedback.
* Introduced a weight decay mechanism to adjust the weights of the reward functions based on the performance of the agents.
