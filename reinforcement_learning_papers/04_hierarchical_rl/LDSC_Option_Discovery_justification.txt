Abstract Snippet:
Option Discovery Using LLM-guided Semantic Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning  arXiv:2503.19007v1 [cs.LG] 24 Mar 2025  Chak Lam Shek1 and Pratap Tokekar2 Abstract— Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in reasoning and decision-making, yet their integration with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for complex robotic tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an LLM-guided hierarchical RL framework, termed LDSC, that leverages LLM-driven subgoal selection and option reuse to enhance sample efficiency, generalization, and multi-task adaptability. Traditional RL methods...
