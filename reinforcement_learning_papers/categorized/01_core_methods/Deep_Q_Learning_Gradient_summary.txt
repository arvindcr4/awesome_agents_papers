**PAPER:** Deep Q-Learning with Gradient Target Tracking
**TITLE:** Deep Q-Learning with Gradient Target Tracking
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 01_core_methods
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. The proposed approach replaces the standard hard target update with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper proposes two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN).
* The authors provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings.
* Empirical evaluations demonstrate the advantages of AGT2-DQN and SGT2-DQN over standard DQN baselines.
* The paper shows that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.
