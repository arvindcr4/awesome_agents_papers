**PAPER**: JaxMARL: Multi-Agent RL Environments and Algorithms in JAX
**TITLE**: JaxMARL: Multi-Agent RL Environments and Algorithms in JAX
**ARXIV_ID**: 2311.10090v5
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: JaxMARL is a library that provides JAX-based implementations of popular multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments and algorithms, enabling significant acceleration and parallelization over existing implementations. The library includes a wide range of MARL environments, such as MPE, SMAX, STORM, Coin Game, Switch Riddle, Hanabi, Overcooked, and MABrax, as well as popular baseline algorithms like IPPO, MAPPO, QMIX, and VDN.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* JAX Implementations of Popular MARL Environments: JaxMARL provides JAX-based implementations of a wide range of popular MARL environments, enabling fast experimentation across diverse environments.
* New MARL Environment Suites: JaxMARL introduces two new MARL environment suites: SMAX and STORM.
* Implementation of Popular MARL Algorithms in JAX: JaxMARL implements many popular MARL algorithms in JAX, such as IPPO, MAPPO, and QMIX.
* Comprehensive Benchmarking: JaxMARL thoroughly benchmarks the speed and correctness of its environments and algorithms, comparing them to existing popular repositories.
* Environment Evaluation Recommendations and Best Practice: JaxMARL provides environment evaluation recommendations for different MARL research settings and scripts for large-scale evaluation and plotting based on best practices in the field.
