Abstract
Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved outstanding results in recent years. This has led
to a dramatic increase in the number of applications and methods. Recent works have explored
learning beyond single-agent scenarios and have considered multiagent learning (MAL) scenarios.
Initial results report successes in complex multiagent domains, although there are several challenges
to be addressed. The primary goal of this article is to provide a clear overview of current multiagent
deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) literature. Additionally, we complement the overview with a
broader analysis: (i) we revisit previous key components, originally presented in MAL and RL, and
highlight how they have been adapted to multiagent deep reinforcement learning settings. (ii) We
provide general guidelines to new practitioners in the area: describing lessons learned from MDRL
works, pointing to recent benchmarks, and outlining open avenues of research. (iii) We take a
more critical tone raising practical challenges of MDRL (e.g., implementation and computational
demands). We expect this article will help unify and motivate future research to take advantage of
the abundant literature that exists (e.g., RL and MAL) in a joint effort to promote fruitful research
in the multiagent community.

1. Introduction
Almost 20 years ago Stone and Veloso’s seminal survey [1] laid the groundwork for defining the
area of multiagent systems (MAS) and its open problems in the context of AI. About ten years
ago, Shoham, Powers, and Grenager [2] noted that the literature on multiagent learning (MAL)
was growing and it was not possible to enumerate all relevant articles. Since then, the number of
published MAL works continues to steadily rise, which led to different surveys on the area, ranging
from analyzing the basics of MAL and their challenges [3, 4, 5], to addressing specific subareas:
game theory and MAL [2, 6], cooperative scenarios [7, 8], and evolutionary dynamics of MAL [9].
In just the last couple of years, three surveys related to MAL have been published: learning in
non-stationary environments [10], agents modeling agents [11], and transfer learning in multiagent
RL [12].
The research interest in MAL has been accompanied by successes in artificial intelligence,
first, in single-agent video games [13]; more recently, in two-player games, for example, playing

Go [14, 15], poker [16, 17], and games of two competing teams, e.g., DOTA 2 [18] and StarCraft
II [19].
While different techniques and algorithms were used in the above scenarios, in general, they are
all a combination of techniques from two main areas: reinforcement learning (RL) [20] and deep
learning [21, 22].
RL is an area of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting (i.e., taking actions)
within a dynamic environment. However, one of the main challenges to RL, and traditional machine learning in general, is the need for manually designing quality features on which to learn.
Deep learning enables efficient representation learning, thus allowing the automatic discovery of
features [21, 22]. In recent years, deep learning has had successes in different areas such as computer vision and natural language processing [21, 22]. One of the key aspects of deep learning is the
use of neural networks (NNs) that can find compact representations in high-dimensional data [23].
In deep reinforcement learning (DRL) [23, 24] deep neural networks are trained to approximate
the optimal policy and/or the value function. In this way the deep NN, serving as function
approximator, enables powerful generalization. One of the key advantages of DRL is that it enables
RL to scale to problems with high-dimensional state and action spaces. However, most existing
successful DRL applications so far have been on visual domains (e.g., Atari games), and there is
still a lot of work to be done for more realistic applications [25, 26] with complex dynamics, which
are not necessarily vision-based.
DRL has been regarded as an important component in constructing general AI systems [27]
and has been successfully integrated with other techniques, e.g., search [14], planning [28], and
more recently with multiagent systems, with an emerging area of multiagent deep reinforcement
learning (MDRL)[29, 30].1
Learning in multiagent settings is fundamentally more difficult than the single-agent case due to
the presence of multiagent pathologies, e.g., the moving target problem (non-stationarity) [2, 5, 10],
curse of dimensionality [2, 5], multiagent credit assignment [31, 32], global exploration [8], and
relative overgeneralization [33, 34, 35]. Despite this complexity, top AI conferences like AAAI,
ICML, ICLR, IJCAI and NeurIPS, and specialized conferences such as AAMAS, have published
works reporting successes in MDRL. In light of these works, we believe it is pertinent to first, have
an overview of the recent MDRL works, and second, understand how these recent works relate to
the existing literature.
This article contributes to the state of the art with a brief survey of the current works in
MDRL in an effort to complement existing surveys on multiagent learning [36, 10], cooperative
learning [7, 8], agents modeling agents [11], knowledge reuse in multiagent RL [12], and (singleagent) deep reinforcement learning [23, 37].
First, we provide a short review of key algorithms in RL such as Q-learning and REINFORCE
(see Section 2.1). Second, we review DRL highlighting the challenges in this setting and reviewing
recent works (see Section 2.2). Third, we present the multiagent setting and give an overview of
key challenges and results (see Section 3.1). Then, we present the identified four categories to
group recent MDRL works (see Figure 1):
• Analysis of emergent behaviors: evaluate single-agent DRL algorithms in multiagent scenarios
(e.g., Atari games, social dilemmas, 3D competitive games).
• Learning communication: agents learn communication protocols to solve cooperative tasks.

• Learning cooperation: agents learn to cooperate using only actions and (local) observations.
• Agents modeling agents: agents reason about others to fulfill a task (e.g., best response
learners).
For each category we provide a description as well as outline the recent works (see Section 3.2
and Tables 1–4). Then, we take a step back and reflect on how these new works relate to the existing
literature. In that context, first, we present examples on how methods and algorithms originally
introduced in RL and MAL were successfully been scaled to MDRL (see Section 4.1). Second,
we provide some pointers for new practitioners in the area by describing general lessons learned
from the existing MDRL works (see Section 4.2) and point to recent multiagent benchmarks (see
Section 4.3). Third, we take a more critical view and describe practical challenges in MDRL, such
as reproducibility, hyperparameter tunning, and computational demands (see Section 4.4). Then,
we outline some open research questions (see Section 4.5). Lastly, we present our conclusions from
this work (see Section 5).
Our goal is to outline a recent and active area (i.e., MDRL), as well as to motivate future
research to take advantage of the ample and existing literature in multiagent learning. We aim to
enable researchers with experience in either DRL or MAL to gain a common understanding about
recent works, and open problems in MDRL, and to avoid having scattered sub-communities with
little interaction [2, 10, 11, 38].
2. Single-agent learning
This section presents the formalism of reinforcement learning and its main components before
outlining deep reinforcement learning along with its particular challenges and recent algorithms.

For a more detailed description we refer the reader to excellent books and surveys on the area [39,
20, 23, 40, 24].
2.1. Reinforcement learning
RL formalizes the interaction of an agent with an environment using a Markov decision process
(MDP) [41]. An MDP is defined by the tuple hS, A, R, T, γi where S represents a finite set of states.
A represents a finite set of actions. The transition function T : S × A × S → [0, 1] determines the
probability of a transition from any state s ∈ S to any state s0 ∈ S given any possible action a ∈ A.
The reward function R : S × A × S → R defines the immediate and possibly stochastic reward that
an agent would receive given that the agent executes action a while in state s and it is transitioned
to state s0 , γ ∈ [0, 1] represents the discount factor that balances the trade-off between immediate
rewards and future rewards.
MDPs are adequate models to obtain optimal decisions in single agent fully observable environments.2 Solving an MDP will yield a policy π : S → A, which is a mapping from states to actions.
An optimal policy π ∗ is the one that maximizes the expected discounted sum of rewards. There are
different techniques for solving MDPs assuming a complete description of all its elements. One of
the most common techniques is the value iteration algorithm [44], which requires a complete and
accurate representation of states, actions, rewards, and transitions. However, this may be difficult
to obtain in many domains. For this reason, RL algorithms often learn from experience interacting
with the environment in discrete time steps.
Q-learning. One of the most well known algorithms for RL is Q-learning [45]. It has been devised
for stationary, single-agent, fully observable environments with discrete actions. A Q-learning agent
keeps the estimate of its expected payoff starting in state s, taking action a as Q̂(s, a). Each tabular
entry Q̂(s, a) is an estimate of the corresponding optimal Q∗ function that maps state-action pairs
to the discounted sum of future rewards starting with action a at state s and following the optimal
policy thereafter. Each time the agent transitions from a state s to a state s0 via action a receiving
payoff r, the Q table is updated as follows:
Q̂(s, a) ← Q̂(s, a) + α[(r + γ max
Q̂(s0 , a0 )) − Q̂(s, a)]
0
a

with the learning rate α ∈ [0, 1]. Q-learning is proven to converge to Q∗ if state and action spaces
are discrete and finite, the sum of the learning rates goes to infinity (so that each state-action pair
is visited infinitely often) and that the sum of the squares of the learning rates is finite (which
is required to show that the convergence is with probability one) [46, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51].
The convergence of single-step on-policy RL algorithms, i.e, SARSA (λ = 0), for both decaying
exploration (greedy in the limit with infinite exploration) and persistent exploration (selecting
actions probabilistically according to the ranks of the Q values) was demonstrated by Singh et
al. [52]. Furthermore, Van Seijen [53] has proven convergence for Expected SARSA (see Section 3.1
for convergence results in multiagent domains).

A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [42, 43] explicitly models environments where the
agent no longer sees the true system state and instead receives an observation (generated from the underlying system
state).

REINFORCE (Monte Carlo policy gradient). In contrast to value-based methods, which do not
try to optimize directly over a policy space [54], policy gradient methods can learn parameterized
policies without using intermediate value estimates.
Policy parameters are learned by following the gradient of some performance measure with
gradient descent [55]. For example, REINFORCE [56] uses estimated return by Monte Carlo (MC)
methods with full episode trajectories to learn policy parameters θ, with π(a; s, θ) ≈ π(a; s), as
follows
∇π(At ; St , θt )
θt+1 = θt + αGt
(2)
π(At ; St , θt )
where Gt represents the return, α is the learning rate, and At ∼ π. A main limitation is that policy
gradient methods can have high variance [54].
The policy gradient update can be generalized to include a comparison to an arbitrary baseline
of the state [56]. The baseline, b(s), can be any function, as long as it does not vary with the
action; the baseline leaves the expected value of the update unchanged, but it can have an effect
on its variance [20]. A natural choice for the baseline is a learned state-value function, this reduces
the variance, and it is bias-free if learned by MC.3 Moreover, when using the state-value function
for bootstrapping (updating the value estimate for a state from the estimated values of subsequent
states) it assigns credit (reducing the variance but introducing bias), i.e., criticizes the policy’s
action selections. Thus, in actor-critic methods [54], the actor represents the policy, i.e., actionselection mechanism, whereas a critic is used for the value function learning. In the case when
the critic learns a state-action function (Q function) and a state value function (V function), an
advantage function can be computed by subtracting state values from the state-action values [20,
60]. The advantage function indicates the relative quality of an action compared to other available
actions computed from the baseline, i.e., state value function. An example of an actor-critic
algorithm is Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) [61]. In DPG [61] the critic follows the standard
Q-learning and the actor is updated following the gradient of the policy’s performance [62], DPG
was later extended to DRL (see Section 2.2) and MDRL (see Section 3.5). For multiagent learning
settings the variance is further increased as all the agents’ rewards depend on the rest of the agents,
and it is formally shown that as the number of agents increase, the probability of taking a correct
gradient direction decreases exponentially [63]. Recent MDRL works addressed this high variance
issue, e.g., COMA [64] and MADDPG [63] (see Section 3.5).
Policy gradient methods have a clear connection with deep reinforcement learning since the
policy might be represented by a neural network whose input is a representation of the state, whose
output are action selection probabilities or values for continuous control [65], and whose weights
are the policy parameters.
2.2. Deep reinforcement learning
While tabular RL methods such as Q-learning are successful in domains that do not suffer
from the curse of dimensionality, there are many limitations: learning in large state spaces can be
prohibitively slow, methods do not generalize (across the state space), and state representations
need to be hand-specified [20]. Function approximators tried to address those limitations, using
3
Action-dependant baselines had been proposed [57, 58], however, a recent study by Tucker et al. [59] found that
in many works the reason of good performance was because of bugs or errors in the code, rather than the proposed
method itself.

for example, decision trees [66], tile coding [67], radial basis functions [68], and locally weighted
regression [69] to approximate the value function.
Similarly, these challenges can be addressed by using deep learning, i.e., neural networks [69, 66]
as function approximators. For example, Q(s, a; θ) can be used to approximate the state-action
values with θ representing the neural network weights. This has two advantages, first, deep learning
helps to generalize across states improving the sample efficiency for large state-space RL problems.
Second, deep learning can be used to reduce (or eliminate) the need for manually designing features
to represent state information [21, 22].
However, extending deep learning to RL problems comes with additional challenges including
non-i.i.d. (not independently and identically distributed) data. Many supervised learning methods
assume that training data is from an i.i.d. stationary distribution [70, 22, 71]. However, in RL,
training data consists of highly correlated sequential agent-environment interactions, which violates
the independence condition. Moreover, RL training data distribution is non-stationary as the agent
actively learns while exploring different parts of the state space, violating the condition of sampled
data being identically distributed [72].
In practice, using function approximators in RL requires making crucial representational decisions and poor design choices can result in estimates that diverge from the optimal value function [73, 69, 74, 75, 76, 77]. In particular, function approximation, bootstrapping, and off-policy
learning are considered the three main properties that when combined, can make the learning to diverge and are known as the deadly triad [77, 20]. Recently, some works have shown that non-linear
(i.e., deep) function approximators poorly estimate the value function [78, 59, 79] and another
work found problems with Q-learning using function approximation (over/under-estimation, instability and even divergence) due to the delusional bias: “delusional bias occurs whenever a
backed-up value estimate is derived from action choices that are not realizable in the underlying
policy class”[80]. Additionally, convergence results for reinforcement learning using function approximation are still scarce [74, 81, 82, 83, 80]; in general, stronger convergence guarantees are
available for policy-gradient methods [55] than for value-based methods [20].
Below we mention how the existing DRL methods aim to address these challenges when briefly
reviewing value-based methods, such as DQN [13]; policy gradient methods, like Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) [60]; and actor-critic methods like Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic
(A3C) [84]. We refer the reader to recent surveys on single-agent DRL [23, 37, 24] for a more
detailed discussion of the literature.
Value-based methods. The major breakthrough work combining deep learning with Q-learning was
the Deep Q-Network (DQN) [13]. DQN uses a deep neural network for function approximation [87]4 (see Figure 2) and maintains an experience replay (ER) buffer [89, 90] to store interactions
hs, a, r, s0 i. DQN keeps an additional copy of neural network parameters, θ− , for the target network in addition to the θ parameters to stabilize the learning, i.e., to alleviate the non-stationary
data distribution.5 For each training iteration i, DQN minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE)
between the Q-network and its target network using the loss function:
4
Before DQN, many approaches used neural networks for representing the Q-value function [88], such as Neural
Fitted Q-learning [87] and NEAT+Q [75].
5
Double Q-learning [91] originally proposed keeping two Q functions (estimators) to reduce the overestimation
bias in RL, while still keeping the convergence guarantees, later it was extended to DRL in Double DQN [92] (see
Section 4.1).

Figure 2: Deep Q-Network (DQN) [13]: Inputs are four stacked frames; the network is composed of several layers:
Convolutional layers employ filters to learn features from high-dimensional data with a much smaller number of
neurons and Dense layers are fully-connected layers. The last layer represents the actions the agent can take (in
this case, 10 possible actions). Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) [85], which extends DQN to partially observable
domains [42], is identical to this setup except the penultimate layer (1 × 256 Dense layer) is replaced with a recurrent
LSTM layer [86].

where target network parameters θ− are set to Q-network parameters θ periodically and minibatches of hs, a, r, s0 i tuples are sampled from the ER buffer, as depicted in Figure 3.
The ER buffer provides stability for learning as random batches sampled from the buffer helps
alleviating the problems caused by the non-i.i.d. data. However, it comes with disadvantages,
such as higher memory requirements and computation per real interaction [93]. The ER buffer is
mainly used for off-policy RL methods as it can cause a mismatch between buffer content from
earlier policy and from the current policy for on-policy methods [93]. Extending the ER buffer
for the multiagent case is not trivial, see Sections 3.5, 4.1 and 4.2. Recent works were designed
to reduce the problem of catastrophic forgetting (this occurs when the trained neural network
performs poorly on previously learned tasks due to a non-stationary training distribution [94, 95])
and the ER buffer, in DRL [96] and MDRL [97].
DQN has been extended in many ways, for example, by using double estimators [91] to reduce
the overestimation bias with Double DQN [92] (see Section 4.1) and by decomposing the Q-function
with a dueling-DQN architecture [98], where two streams are learned, one estimates state values
and another one advantages, those are combined in the final layer to form Q values (this method
improved over Double DQN).
In practice, DQN is trained using an input of four stacked frames (last four frames the agent has
encountered). If a game requires a memory of more than four frames it will appear non-Markovian
to DQN because the future game states (and rewards) do not depend only on the input (four
frames) but rather on the history [99]. Thus, DQN’s performance declines when given incomplete
state observations (e.g., one input frame) since DQN assumes full state observability.
Real-world tasks often feature incomplete and noisy state information resulting from partial
observability (see Section 2.1). Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN) [85] proposed using recurrent
neural networks, in particular, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) cells [86] in DQN, for this
setting. Consider the architecture in Figure 2 with the first dense layer after convolution replaced

those at every timestep.

by a layer of LSTM cells. With this addition, DRQN has memory capacity so that it can even
work with only one input frame rather than a stacked input of consecutive frames. This idea has
been extended to MDRL, see Figure 6 and Section 4.2. There are also other approaches to deal
with partial observability such as finite state controllers [100] (where action selection is performed
according to the complete observation history) and using an initiation set of options conditioned
on the previously employed option [101].
Policy gradient methods. For many tasks, particularly for physical control, the action space is
continuous and high dimensional where DQN is not suitable. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG) [65] is a model-free off-policy actor-critic algorithm for such domains, based on the DPG
algorithm [61] (see Section 2.1). Additionally, it proposes a new method for updating the networks,
i.e., the target network parameters slowly change (this could also be applicable to DQN), in contrast
to the hard reset (direct weight copy) used in DQN. Given the off-policy nature, DDPG generates
exploratory behavior by adding sampled noise from some noise processes to its actor policy. The
authors also used batch normalization [102] to ensure generalization across many different tasks
without performing manual normalizations. However, note that other works have shown batch
normalization can cause divergence in DRL [103, 104].
Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) [93] is an algorithm that employs a parallelized
asynchronous training scheme (using multiple CPU threads) for efficiency. It is an on-policy
RL method that does not use an experience replay buffer. A3C allows multiple workers to
simultaneously interact with the environment and compute gradients locally. All the workers
pass their computed local gradients to a global NN which performs the optimization and synchronizes with the workers asynchronously (see Figure 4). There is also the Advantage ActorCritic (A2C) method [105] that combines all the gradients from all the workers to update the
global NN synchronously. The loss function for A3C is composed of two terms: policy loss (actor), Lπ , and value loss (critic), Lv . A3C parameters are updated using the advantage function
A(st , at ; θv ) = Q(s, a) − V (s), commonly used to reduce variance (see Section 2.1). An entropy loss
for the policy, H(π), is also commonly added, which helps to improve exploration by discouraging
premature convergence to suboptimal deterministic policies [93]. Thus, the loss function is given
by: LA3C = λv Lv + λπ Lπ − λH Es∼π [H(π(s, ·, θ)] with λv , λπ , and λH , being weighting terms on the
individual loss components. Wang et al. [106] took A3C’s framework but used off-policy learning
8

Figure 4: Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) employs multiple (CPUs) workers without needing an ER
buffer. Each worker has its own NN and independently interacts with the environment to compute the loss and
gradients. Workers then pass computed gradients to the global NN that optimizes the parameters and synchronizes
with the worker asynchronously. This distributed system is designed for single-agent deep RL. Compared to different
DQN variants, A3C obtains better performance on a variety of Atari games using substantially less training time
with multiple CPU cores of standard laptops without a GPU [93]. However, we note that more recent approaches
use both multiple CPU cores for more efficient training data generation and GPUs for more efficient learning.

to create the Actor-critic with experience replay (ACER) algorithm. Gu et al. [107] introduced
the Interpolated Policy Gradient (IPG) algorithm and showed a connection between ACER and
DDPG: they are a pair of reparametrization terms (they are special cases of IPG) when they are
put under the same stochastic policy setting, and when the policy is deterministic they collapse
into DDPG.
Jaderberg et al. [84] built the Unsupervised Reinforcement and Auxiliary Learning (UNREAL)
framework on top of A3C and introduced unsupervised auxiliary tasks (e.g., reward prediction)
to speed up the learning process. Auxiliary tasks in general are not used for anything other
than shaping the features of the agent, i.e., facilitating and regularizing the representation learning process [108, 109]; their formalization in RL is related to the concept of general value functions
P [20, 110]. The UNREAL framework optimizes a combined loss function LUNREAL ≈ LA3C +
i λATi LATi , that combines the A3C loss, LA3C , together with auxiliary task losses LATi , where
λATi are weight terms (see Section 4.1 for use of auxiliary tasks in MDRL). In contrast to A3C, UNREAL uses a prioritized ER buffer, in which transitions with positive reward are given higher probability of being sampled. This approach can be viewed as a simple form of prioritized replay [111],
which was in turn inspired by model-based RL algorithms like prioritized sweeping [112, 113].
Another distributed architecture is the Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture (IM9

PALA) [114]. Unlike A3C or UNREAL, IMPALA actors communicate trajectories of experience
(sequences of states, actions, and rewards) to a centralized learner, thus IMPALA decouples acting
from learning.
Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) [60] and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [115]
are recently proposed policy gradient algorithms where the latter represents the state-of-the art
with advantages such as being simpler to implement and having better empirical sample complexity. Interestingly, a recent work [79] studying PPO and TRPO arrived at the surprising conclusion
that these methods often deviate from what the theoretical framework would predict: gradient
estimates are poorly correlated with the true gradient and value networks tend to produce inaccurate predictions for the true value function. Compared to vanilla policy gradient algorithms, PPO
prevents abrupt changes in policies during training through the loss function, similar to early work
by Kakade [116]. Another advantage of PPO is that it can be used in a distributed fashion, i.e,
Distributed PPO (DPPO) [117]. Note that distributed approaches like DPPO or A3C use parallelization only to improve the learning by more efficient training data generation through multiple
CPU cores for single agent DRL and they should not be considered multiagent approaches (except
for recent work which tries to exploit this parallelization in a multiagent environment [118]).
Lastly, there’s a connection between policy gradient algorithms and Q-learning [119] within the
framework of entropy-regularized reinforcement learning [120] where the value and Q functions are
slightly altered to consider the entropy of the policy. In this vein, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [121] is
a recent algorithm that concurrently learns a stochastic policy, two Q-functions (taking inspiration
from Double Q-learning) and a value function. SAC alternates between collecting experience with
the current policy and updating from batches sampled from the ER buffer.
We have reviewed recent algorithms in DRL, while the list is not exhaustive, it provides an
overview of the different state-of-art techniques and algorithms which will become useful while
describing the MDRL techniques in the next section.
3. Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MDRL)
First, we briefly introduce the general framework on multiagent learning and then we dive into
the categories and the research on MDRL.
3.1. Multiagent Learning
Learning in a multiagent environment is inherently more complex than in the single-agent
case, as agents interact at the same time with environment and potentially with each other [5].
The independent learners, a.k.a. decentralized learners approach [122] directly uses single-agent
algorithms in the multi-agent setting despite the underlying assumptions of these algorithms being
violated (each agent independently learns its own policy, treating other agents as part of the
environment). In particular the Markov property (the future dynamics, transitions, and rewards
depend only on the current state) becomes invalid since the environment is no longer stationary [4,
6, 123]. This approach ignores the multiagent nature of the setting entirely and it can fail when
an opponent adapts or learns, for example, based on the past history of interactions [2]. Despite
the lack of guarantees, independent learners have been used in practice, providing advantages with
regards to scalability while often achieving good results [8].
To understand why multiagent domains are non-stationary from agents’ local perspectives,
consider a simple stochastic (also known as Markov) game (S, N , A, T , R), which can be seen as
an extension of an MDP to multiple agents [124, 125]. One key distinction is that the transition,
10

T , and reward function, R, depend on the actions A = A1 × ... × AN of all, N , agents, this means,
R = R1 × ... × RN and T = S × A1 × ... × AN .
Given a learning agent i and using the common shorthand notation −i = N \ {i} for the set of
opponents,Qthe value function now depends on the joint action a = (ai , a−i ), and the joint policy

Specifically, the opponents’ joint policy π−i (s, a−i ) can be non-stationary, i.e., changes as the
opponents’ policies change over time, for example with learning opponents.
Convergence results. Littman [125] studied convergence properties of reinforcement learning joint
action agents [126] in Markov games with the following conclusions: in adversarial environments
(zero-sum games) an optimal play can be guaranteed against an arbitrary opponent, i.e., Minimax
Q-learning [124]. In coordination environments (e.g., in cooperative games all agents share the same
reward function), strong assumptions need be made about other agents to guarantee convergence
to optimal behavior [125], e.g., Nash Q-learning [127] and Friend-or-Foe Q-learning [128]. In other
types of environments no value-based RL algorithms with guaranteed convergence properties are
known [125].
Recent work on MDRL have addressed scalability and have focused significantly less on convergence guarantees, with few exceptions [129, 130, 131, 132]. One notable work has shown a
connection between update rules for actor-critic algorithms for multiagent partially observable settings and (counterfactual) regret minimization:7 the advantage values are scaled counterfactual
regrets. This lead to new convergence properties of independent RL algorithms in zero-sum games
with imperfect information [136]. The result is also used to support policy gradient optimization
against worst-case opponents, in a new algorithm called Exploitability Descent [137].8
We refer the interested reader to seminal works about convergence in multiagent domains [139,
140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149]. Note that instead of convergence, some MAL
algorithms have proved learning a best response against classes of opponents [150, 151, 152].
There are other common problems in MAL, including action shadowing [34, 33], the curse of
dimensionality [5], and multiagent credit assignment [32]. Describing each problem is out of the

In this setting each agent independently executes a policy, however, there are other cases where this does not
hold, for example when agents have a coordinated exploration strategy.
7
Counterfactual regret minimization is a technique for solving large games based on regret minimization [133, 134]
due to a well-known connection between regret and Nash equilibria [135]. It has been one of the reasons of successes
in Poker [16, 17].
8
This algorithm is similar to CFR-BR [138] and has the main advantage that the current policy convergences
rather than the average policy, so there is no need to learn the average strategy, which requires large reservoir buffers
or many past networks.

scope of this survey. However, we refer the interested reader to excellent resources on general
MAL [4, 153, 154], as well as surveys in specific areas: game theory and multiagent reinforcement learning [5, 6], cooperative scenarios [7, 8], evolutionary dynamics of multiagent learning [9],
learning in non-stationary environments [10], agents modeling agents [11], and transfer learning in
multiagent RL [12].
3.2. MDRL categorization
In Section 2.2 we outlined some recent works in single-agent DRL since an exhaustive list is out
of the scope of this article. This explosion of works has led DRL to be extended and combined with
other techniques [23, 37, 29]. One natural extension to DRL is to test whether these approaches
could be applied in a multiagent environment.
We analyzed the most recent works (that are not covered by previous MAL surveys [10, 11]
and we do not consider genetic algorithms or swarm intelligence in this survey) that have a clear
connection with MDRL. We propose 4 categories which take inspiration from previous surveys [1,
5, 7, 11] and that conveniently describe and represent current works. Note that some of these works
fit into more than one category (they are not mutually exclusive), therefore their summaries are
presented in all applicable Tables 1-4, however, for the ease of exposition when describing them in
the text we only do so in one category. Additionally, for each work we present its learning type,
either a value-based method (e.g., DQN) or a policy gradient method (e.g., actor-critic); also, we
mention if the setting is evaluated in a fully cooperative, fully competitive or mixed environment
(both cooperative and competitive).
• Analysis of emergent behaviors. These works, in general, do not propose learning algorithms
— their main focus is to analyze and evaluate DRL algorithms, e.g., DQN [155, 156, 157],
PPO [158, 157] and others [159, 157, 160], in a multiagent environment. In this category we
found works which analyze behaviors in the three major settings: cooperative, competitive
and mixed scenarios; see Section 3.3 and Table 1.
• Learning communication [161, 160, 162, 163, 164, 165]. These works explore a sub-area
in which agents can share information with communication protocols, for example through
direct messages [162] or via a shared memory [165]. This area is attracting attention and it
had not been explored much in the MAL literature. See Section 3.4 and Table 2.
• Learning cooperation. While learning to communicate is an emerging area, fostering cooperation in learning agents has a long history of research in MAL [7, 8]. In this category
the analyzed works are evaluated in either cooperative or mixed settings. Some works in
this category take inspiration from MAL (e.g., leniency, hysteresis, and difference rewards
concepts) and extend them to the MDRL setting [35, 166, 167]. A notable exception [168]
takes a key component from RL (i.e., experience replay buffer) and adapts it for MDRL. See
Section 3.5 and Table 3.
• Agents modeling agents. Albrecht and Stone [11] presented a thorough survey in this topic
and we have found many works that fit into this category in the MDRL setting, some taking
inspiration from DRL [169, 170, 171], and others from MAL [172, 173, 64, 174, 175]. Modeling
agents is helpful not only to cooperate, but also for modeling opponents [172, 169, 171, 173],
inferring goals [170], and accounting for the learning behavior of other agents [64]. In this
category the analyzed algorithms present their results in either a competitive setting or a
mixed one (cooperative and competitive). See Section 3.6 and Table 4.
12

In the rest of this section we describe each category along with the summaries of related works.
3.3. Emergent behaviors
Some recent works have analyzed the previously mentioned independent DRL agents (see Section 3.1) from the perspective of types of emerging behaviors (e.g., cooperative or competitive).
One of the earliest MDRL works is by Tampuu et al. [155], which had two independent DQN
learning agents to play the Atari Pong game. Their focus was to adapt the reward function for the
learning agents, which resulted in either cooperative or competitive emergent behaviors.
Leibo et al. [156] meanwhile studied independent DQNs in the context of sequential social
dilemmas: a Markov game that satisfies certain inequalities [156]. The focus of this work was
to highlight that cooperative or competitive behaviors exist not only as discrete (atomic) actions,
but they are temporally extended (over policies). In the related setting of one shot Markov social
dilemmas, Lerer and Peysakhovich [176] extended the famous Tit-for-Tat (TFT)9 strategy [187]
for DRL (using function approximators) and showed (theoretically and experimentally) that such
agents can maintain cooperation. To construct the agents they used self-play and two reward
schemes: selfish and cooperative. Previously, different MAL algorithms were designed to foster
cooperation in social dilemmas with Q-learning agents [188, 189].
Self-play is a useful concept for learning algorithms (e.g., fictitious play [190]) since under certain
classes of games it can guarantee convergence10 and it has been used as a standard technique in
previous RL and MAL works [192, 14, 193]. Despite its common usage self-play can be brittle
to forgetting past knowledge [194, 172, 195] (see Section 4.5 for a note on the role of self-play
as an open question in MDRL). To overcome this issue, Leibo et al. [159] proposed Malthusian
reinforcement learning as an extension of self-play to population dynamics. The approach can be
thought of as community coevolution and has been shown to produce better results (avoiding local
optima) than independent agents with intrinsic motivation [196]. A limitation of this work is that it
does not place itself within the state of the art in evolutionary and genetic algorithms. Evolutionary
strategies have been employed for solving reinforcement learning problems [197] and for evolving
function approximators [75]. Similarly, they have been used multiagent scenarios to compute
approximate Nash equilibria [198] and as metaheuristic optimization algorithms [199, 200, 7, 201].
Bansal et al. [158] explored the emergent behaviors in competitive scenarios using the MuJoCo simulator [202]. They trained independent learning agents with PPO and incorporated two
main modifications to deal with the MAL nature of the problem. First, they used exploration
rewards [203] which are dense rewards that allow agents to learn basic (non-competitive) behaviors
— this type of reward is annealed through time giving more weight to the environmental (competitive) reward. Exploration rewards come from early work in robotics [204] and single-agent
RL [205], and their goal is to provide dense feedback for the learning algorithm to improve sample efficiency (Ng et al. [206] studied the theoretical conditions under which modifications of the
reward function of an MDP preserve the optimal policy). For multiagent scenarios, these dense
rewards help agents in the beginning phase of the training to learn basic non-competitive skills,
increasing the probability of random actions from the agent yielding a positive reward. The second
9

TFT originated in an iterated prisoner’s dilemma tournament and later inspired different strategies in MAL [185],
its generalization, Godfather, is a representative of leader strategies [186].
10
The average strategy profile of fictitious players converges to a Nash equilibrium in certain classes of games, e.g.,
two-player zero-sum and potential games [191].

contribution was opponent sampling which maintains a pool of older versions of the opponent to
sample from, in contrast to using the most recent version.
Raghu et al. [157] investigated how DRL algorithms (DQN, A2C, and PPO) performed in
a family of two-player zero-sum games with tunable complexity, called Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer
games [207, 208]. Their reasoning is threefold: (i) these games provide a parameterized family
of environments where (ii) optimal behavior can be completely characterized, and (iii) support
multiagent play. Their work showed that algorithms can exhibit wide variation in performance as
the algorithms are tuned to the game’s difficulty.
Lazaridou et al. [161] proposed a framework for language learning that relies on multiagent
communication. The agents, represented by (feed-forward) neural networks, need to develop an
emergent language to solve a task. The task is formalized as a signaling game [209] in which two
agents, a sender and a receiver, obtain a pair of images. The sender is told one of them is the target
and is allowed to send a message (from a fixed vocabulary) to the receiver. Only when the receiver
identifies the target image do both agents receive a positive reward. The results show that agents
can coordinate for the experimented visual-based domain. To analyze the semantic properties11 of
the learned communication protocol they looked whether symbol usage reflects the semantics of
the visual space, and that despite some variation, many high level objects groups correspond to the
same learned symbols using a t-SNE [210] based analysis (t-SNE is a visualization technique for
high-dimensional data and it has also been used to better understand the behavior of trained DRL
agents [211, 212]). A key objective of this work was to determine if the agent’s language could be
human-interpretable. To achieve this, learned symbols were grounded with natural language by
extending the signaling game with a supervised image labelling task (the sender will be encouraged
to use conventional names, making communication more transparent to humans). To measure the
interpretability of the extended game, a crowdsourced survey was performed, and in essence, the
trained agent receiver was replaced with a human. The results showed that 68% of the cases,
human participants picked the correct image.
Similarly, Mordatch and Abbeel [160] investigated the emergence of language with the difference
that in their setting there were no explicit roles for the agents (i.e., sender or receiver). To learn,
they proposed an end-to-end differentiable model of all agent and environment state dynamics over
time to calculate the gradient of the return with backpropagation.
3.4. Learning communication
As we discussed in the previous section, one of the desired emergent behaviors of multiagent
interaction is the emergence of communication [161, 160]. This setting usually considers a set of
cooperative agents in a partially observable environment (see Section 2.2) where agents need to
maximize their shared utility by means of communicating information.
Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning (DIAL) are
two methods using deep networks to learn to communicate [162]. Both methods use a neural
net that outputs the agent’s Q values (as done in standard DRL algorithms) and a message to
communicate to other agents in the next timestep. RIAL is based on DRQN and also uses the
concept of parameter sharing, i.e., using a single network whose parameters are shared among all
agents. In contrast, DIAL directly passes gradients via the communication channel during learning,
and messages are discretized and mapped to the set of communication actions during execution.
11
The vocabulary that agents use was arbitrary and had no initial meaning. To understand its emerging semantics
they looked at the relationship between symbols and the sets of images they referred to [161].

17

Memory-driven (MD) communication was proposed on top of the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) [63] method. In MD-MADDPG [165], the agents use a shared
memory as a communication channel: before taking an action, the agent first reads the memory,
then writes a response. In this case the agent’s policy becomes dependent on its private observation
and its interpretation of the collective memory. Experiments were performed with two agents in
cooperative scenarios. The results highlighted the fact that the communication channel was used
differently in each environment, e.g., in simpler tasks agents significantly decrease their memory
activity near the end of the task as there are no more changes in the environment; in more complex
environments, the changes in memory usage appear at a much higher frequency due to the presence
of many sub-tasks.
Dropout [213] is a technique to prevent overfitting (in supervised learning this happens when the
learning algorithm achieves good performance only on a specific data set and fails to generalize) in
neural networks which is based on randomly dropping units and their connections during training
time. Inspired by dropout, Kim et al. [177] proposed a similar approach in multiagent environments
where direct communication through messages is allowed. In this case, the messages of other agents
are dropped out at training time, thus the authors proposed the Message-Dropout MADDPG
algorithm [177]. This method is expected to work in fully or limited communication environments.
The empirical results show that with properly chosen message dropout rate, the proposed method
both significantly improves the training speed and the robustness of learned policies (by introducing
communication errors) during execution time. This capability is important as MDRL agents trained
in simulated or controlled environments will be less fragile when transferred to more realistic
environments.
While RIAL and DIAL used a discrete communication channel, CommNet [163] used a continuous vector channel. Through this channel agents receive the summed transmissions of other
agents. The authors assume full cooperation and train a single network for all the agents. There
are two distinctive characteristics of CommNet from previous works: it allows multiple communication cycles at each timestep and a dynamic variation of agents at run time, i.e., agents come and
go in the environment.
In contrast to previous approaches, in Multiagent Bidirectionally Coordinated Network (BiCNet) [164], communication takes place in the latent space (i.e., in the hidden layers). It also uses
parameter sharing, however, it proposes bidirectional recurrent neural networks [214] to model the
actor and critic networks of their model. Note that in BiCNet agents do not explicitly share a
message and thus it can be considered a method for learning cooperation.
Learning communication is an active area in MDRL with many open questions, in this context,
we refer the interested reader to a recent work by Lowe et al. [215] where it discusses common pitfalls
(and recommendations to avoid those) while measuring communication in multiagent environments.
3.5. Learning cooperation
Although explicit communication is a new emerging trend in MDRL, there has already been a
large amount of work in MAL for cooperative settings12 that do not involve communication [7, 8].
Therefore, it was a natural starting point for many recent MDRL works.
Foerster et al. [168] studied the simple scenario of cooperation with independent Q-learning
agents (see Section 3.1), where the agents use the standard DQN architecture of neural networks
12
There is a large body of research on coordinating multiagent teams by specifying communication protocols [216,
217]: these expect agents to know the team’s goal as well as the tasks required to accomplish the goal.

and an experience replay buffer (see Figure 3). However, for the ER to work, the data distribution
needs to follow certain assumptions (see Section 2.2) which are no loger valid due to the multiagent
nature of the world: the dynamics that generated the data in the ER no longer reflect the current
dynamics, making the experience obsolete [168, 90]. Their solution is to add information to the
experience tuple that can help to disambiguate the age of the sampled data from the replay memory.
Two approaches were proposed. The first is Multiagent Importance Sampling which adds the
probability of the joint action so an importance sampling correction [70, 218] can computed when
the tuple is later sampled for training. This was similar to previous works in adaptive importance
sampling [219, 220] and off-environment RL [221]. The second approach is Multiagent Fingerprints
which adds the estimate (i.e., fingerprint) of other agents’ policies (loosely inspired by HyperQ [150], see Section 4.1). For the practical implementation, good results were obtained by using
the training iteration number and exploration rate as the fingerprint.
Gupta et al. [182] tackled cooperative environments in partially observable domains without
explicit communication. They proposed parameter sharing (PS) as a way to improve learning in
homogeneous multiagent environments (where agents have the same set of actions). The idea is to
have one globally shared learning network that can still behave differently in execution time, i.e.,
because its inputs (individual agent observation and agent index) will be different. They tested
three variations of this approach with parameter sharing: PS-DQN, PS-DDPG and PS-TRPO,
which extended single-agent DQN, DDPG and TRPO algorithms, respectively. The results showed
that PS-TRPO outperformed the other two. Note that Foerster et al. [162] concurrently proposed
a similar concept, see Section 3.4.
Lenient-DQN (LDQN) [35] took the leniency concept [222] (originally presented in MAL) and
extended their use to MDRL. The purpose of leniency is to overcome a pathology called relative overgeneralization [34, 223, 224]. Similar to other approaches designed to overcome relative
overgeneralization (e.g., distributed Q-learning [225] and hysteretic Q-learning [8]) lenient learners initially maintain an optimistic disposition to mitigate the noise from transitions resulting in
miscoordination, preventing agents from being drawn towards sub-optimal but wide peaks in the
reward search space [97]. However, similar to other MDRL works [168], the LDQN authors experienced problems with the ER buffer and arrived at a similar solution: adding information to the
experience tuple, in their case, the leniency value. When sampling from the ER buffer, this value
is used to determine a leniency condition; if the condition is not met then the sample is ignored.
In a similar vein, Decentralized-Hysteretic Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DEC-HDRQNs) [166]
were proposed for fostering cooperation among independent learners. The motivation is similar
to LDQN, making an optimistic value update, however, their solution is different. Here, the
authors took inspiration from Hysteretic Q-learning [8], originally presented in MAL, where two
learning rates were used. A difference between lenient agents and hysteretic Q-learning is that
lenient agents are only initially forgiving towards teammates. Lenient learners over time apply
less leniency towards updates that would lower utility values, taking into account how frequently
observation-action pairs have been encountered. The idea being that the transition from optimistic
to average reward learner will help make lenient learners more robust towards misleading stochastic
rewards [222]. Additionally, in DEC-HDRQNs the ER buffer is also extended into concurrent
experience replay trajectories, which are composed of three dimensions: agent index, the episode,
and the timestep; when training, the sampled traces have the same starting timesteps. Moreover,
to improve on generalization over different tasks, i.e., multi-task learning[226], DEC-HDRQNs
make use of policy distillation [227, 228] (see Section 4.1). In contrast to other approaches, DEC19

Figure 5: A schematic view of the architecture used in FTW (For the Win) [179]: two unrolled recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) operate at different time-scales, the idea is that the Slow RNN helps with long term temporal
correlations. Observations are latent space output of some convolutional neural network to learn non-linear features.
Feudal Networks [229] is another work in single-agent DRL that also maintains a multi-time scale hierarchy where
the slower network sets the goal, and the faster network tries to achieve them. Fedual Networks were in turn, inspired
by early work in RL which proposed a hierarchy of Q-learners [230, 231].

HDRQNS are fully decentralized during learning and execution.
Weighted Double Deep Q-Network (WDDQN) [178] is based on having double estimators. This
idea was originally introduced in Double Q-learning [91] and aims to remove the existing overestimation bias caused by using the maximum action value as an approximation for the maximum
expected action value (see Section 4.1). It also uses a lenient reward [222] to be optimistic during
initial phase of coordination and proposes a scheduled replay strategy in which samples closer to
the terminal states are heuristically given higher priority; this strategy might not be applicable
for any domain. For other works extending the ER to multiagent settings see MADDPG [63],
Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
While previous approaches were mostly inspired by how MAL algorithms could be extended
to MDRL, other works take as base the results by single-agent DRL. One example is the For The
Win (FTW) [179] agent which is based on the actor-learner structure of IMPALA [114] (see Section 2.2). The authors test FTW in a game where two opposing teams compete to capture each
other’s flags [232]. To deal with the MAL problem they propose two main additions: a hierarchical
two-level representation with recurrent neural networks operating at different timescales, as depicted in Figure 5, and a population based training [233, 234, 235] where 30 agents were trained in
parallel together with a stochastic matchmaking scheme that biases agents to be of similar skills.

20

The Elo rating system [236] was originally devised to rate chess player skills,13 TrueSkill [237]
extended Elo by tracking uncertainty in skill rating, supporting draws, and matches beyond 1 vs
1; α−Rank is a more recent alternative to ELO [238]. FTW did not use TrueSkill but a simpler extension of Elo for n vs n games (by adding individual agent ratings to compute the team
skill). Hierarchical approaches were previously proposed in RL, e.g., Feudal RL [230, 231], and
were later extended to DRL in Feudal networks [229]; population based training can be considered
analogous to evolutionary strategies that employ self-adaptive hyperparameter tuning to modify
how the genetic algorithm itself operates [234, 239, 240]. An interesting result from FTW is that
the population-based training obtained better results than training via self-play [192], which was
a standard concept in previous works [14, 193]. FTW used heavy compute resources, it used 30
agents (processes) in parallel where every training game lasted 4500 agent steps (≈ five minutes)
and agents were trained for two billion steps (≈ 450K games).
Lowe et al. [63] noted that using standard policy gradient methods (see Section 2.1) on multiagent environments yields high variance and performs poorly. This occurs because the variance
is further increased as all the agents’ rewards depend on the rest of the agents, and it is formally shown that as the number of agents increase, the probability of taking a correct gradient
direction decreases exponentially [63]. Therefore, to overcome this issue Lowe et al. proposed the
Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) [63], building on DDPG [65] (see
Section 2.2), to train a centralized critic per agent that is given all agents’ policies during training to reduce the variance by removing the non-stationarity caused by the concurrently learning
agents. Here, the actor only has local information (turning the method into a centralized training
with decentralized execution) and the ER buffer records experiences of all agents. MADDPG was
tested in both cooperative and competitive scenarios, experimental results show that it performs
better than several decentralized methods (such as DQN, DDPG, and TRPO). The authors mention that traditional RL methods do not produce consistent gradient signals. This is exemplified
in a challenging competitive scenarios where agents continuously adapt to each other causing the
learned best-response policies oscillate — for such a domain, MADDPG is shown to learn more
robustly than DDPG.
Another approach based on policy gradients is the Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients
(COMA) [167]. COMA was designed for the fully centralized setting and the multiagent credit
assignment problem [241], i.e., how the agents should deduce their contributions when learning
in a cooperative setting in the presence of only global rewards. Their proposal is to compute a
counterfactual baseline, that is, marginalize out the action of the agent while keeping the rest of
the other agents’ actions fixed. Then, an advantage function can be computed comparing the
current Q value to the counterfactual. This counterfactual baseline has its roots in difference
rewards, which is a method for obtaining the individual contribution of an agent in a cooperative
multiagent team [241]. In particular, the aristocrat utility aims to measure the difference between
an agent’s actual action and the average action [31]. The intention would be equivalent to sideline
the agent by having the agent perform an action where the reward does not depend on the agent’s
actions, i.e., to consider the reward that would have arisen assuming a world without that agent
having ever existed (see Section 4.2).
On the one hand, fully centralized approaches (e.g., COMA) do not suffer from non-stationarity
13
Elo uses a normal distribution for each player skill, and after each match, both players’ distributions are updated
based on measure of surprise, i.e., if a user with previously lower (predicted) skill beats a high skilled one, the
low-skilled player is significantly increased.

(b) Deep Policy Inference Recurrent Q-Network: receives one frame as input and has an LSTM layer instead of a
fully connected layer (FC). Both approaches [171] condition the QM value outputs on the policy features, hP I , which
are also used to learn the opponent policy πo .

but have constrained scalability. On the other hand, independent learning agents are better suited
to scale but suffer from non-stationarity issues. There are some hybrid approaches that learn a
centralized but factored Q value function [242, 243]. Value Decomposition Networks (VDNs) [180]
decompose a team value function into an additive decomposition of the individual value functions.
Similarly, QMIX [181] relies on the idea of factorizing, however, instead of sum, QMIX assumes a
mixing network that combines the local values in a non-linear way, which can represent monotonic
action-value functions. While the mentioned approaches have obtained good empirical results, the
factorization of value-functions in multiagent scenarios using function approximators (MDRL) is
an ongoing research topic, with open questions such as how well factorizations capture complex
coordination problems and how to learn those factorizations [244] (see Section 4.4).
3.6. Agents modeling agents
An important ability for agents to have is to reason about the behaviors of other agents by
constructing models that make predictions about the modeled agents [11]. An early work for
modeling agents while using deep neural networks was the Deep Reinforcement Opponent Network
(DRON) [169]. The idea is to have two networks: one which evaluates Q-values and a second
one that learns a representation of the opponent’s policy. Moreover, the authors proposed to have
several expert networks to combine their predictions to get the estimated Q value, the idea being
that each expert network captures one type of opponent strategy [245]. This is related to previous
22

works in type-based reasoning from game theory [246, 139] later applied in AI [245, 11, 247]. The
mixture of experts idea was presented in supervised learning where each expert handled a subset of
the data (a subtask), and then a gating network decided which of the experts should be used [248].
DRON uses hand-crafted features to define the opponent network. In contrast, Deep Policy
Inference Q-Network (DPIQN) and its recurrent version, DPIRQN [171] learn policy features directly from raw observations of the other agents. The way to learn these policy features is by
means of auxiliary tasks [84, 110] (see Sections 2.2 and 4.1) that provide additional learning goals,
in this case, the auxiliary task is to learn the opponents’ policies. This auxiliary task modifies the
loss function by computing an auxiliary loss: the cross entropy loss between the inferred opponent
policy and the ground truth (one-hot action vector) of the opponent. Then, the Q value function
of the learning agent is conditioned on the opponent’s policy features (see Figure 6), which aims to
reduce the non-stationarity of the environment. The authors used an adaptive training procedure
to adjust the attention (a weight on the loss function) to either emphasize learning the policy features (of the opponent) or the respective Q values of the agent. An advantage of these approaches
is that modeling the agents can work for both opponents and teammates [171].
In many previous works an opponent model is learned from observations. Self Other Modeling
(SOM) [170] proposed a different approach, this is, using the agent’s own policy as a means to
predict the opponent’s actions. SOM can be used in cooperative and competitive settings (with
an arbitrary number of agents) and infers other agents’ goals. This is important because in the
evaluated domains, the reward function depends on the goal of the agents. SOM uses two networks,
one used for computing the agents’ own policy, and a second one used to infer the opponent’s goal.
The idea is that these networks have the same input parameters but with different values (the
agent’s or the opponent’s). In contrast to previous approaches, SOM is not focused on learning
the opponent policy, i.e., a probability distribution over next actions, but rather on estimating the
opponent’s goal. SOM is expected to work best when agents share a set of goals from which each
agent gets assigned one at the beginning of the episode and the reward structure depends on both
of their assigned goals. Despite its simplicity, training takes longer as an additional optimization
step is performed given the other agent’s observed actions.
There is a long-standing history of combining game theory and MAL [2, 6, 193]. From that
context, some approaches were inspired by influential game theory approaches. Neural Fictitious
Self-Play (NFSP) [173] builds on fictitious (self-) play [190, 249], together with two deep networks to
find approximate Nash equilibria 14 in two-player imperfect information games [251] (for example,
consider Poker: when it is an agent’s turn to move it does not have access to all information
about the world). One network learns an approximate best response (−greedy over Q values) to
the historical behavior of other agents and the second one (called the average network) learns to
imitate its own past best response behaviour using supervised classification. The agent behaves
using a mixture of the average and the best response networks depending on the probability of an
anticipatory parameter [252]. Comparisons with DQN in Leduc Holdem Poker revealed that DQN’s
deterministic strategy is highly exploitable. Such strategies are sufficient to behave optimally in
single-agent domains, i.e., MDPs for which DQN was designed. However, imperfect-information
games generally require stochastic strategies to achieve optimal behaviour [173]. DQN learning
experiences are both highly correlated over time, and highly focused on a narrow state distribution.
14
Nash equilibrium [250] is a solution concept in game theory in which no agent would choose to deviate from its
strategy (they are a best response to others’ strategies). This concept has been explored in seminal MAL algorithms
like Nash-Q learning [127] and Minimax-Q learning [124, 128].

23

In contrast to NFSP agents whose experience varies more smoothly, resulting in a more stable data
distribution, more stable neural networks and better performance.
The (N)FSP concept was further generalized in Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) [172],
where it was shown that fictitious play is one specific meta-strategy distribution over a set of
previous (approximate) best responses (summarized by a meta-game obtained by empirical game
theoretic analysis [253]), but there are a wide variety to choose from. One reason to use mixed metastrategies is that it prevents overfitting15 the responses to one specific policy, and hence provides a
form of opponent/teammate regularization. An approximate scalable version of the algorithm leads
to a graph of agents best-responding independently called Deep Cognitive Hierarchies (DCHs) [172]
due to its similarity to behavioral game-theoretic models [255, 256].
Minimax is a paramount concept in game theory that is roughly described as minimizing the
worst case scenario (maximum loss) [251]. Li et al. [183] took the minimax idea as an approach
to robustify learning in multiagent environments so that the learned robust policy should be able
to behave well even with strategies not seen during training. They extended the MADDPG algorithm [63] to Minimax Multiagent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (M3DDPG), which updates
policies considering a worst-case scenario: assuming that all other agents act adversarially. This
yields a minimax learning objective which is computationally intractable to directly optimize. They
address this issue by taking ideas from robust reinforcement learning [257] which implicitly adopts
the minimax idea by using the worst noise concept [258]. In MAL different approaches were proposed to assess the robustness of an algorithm, e.g., guarantees of safety [152, 259], security [260]
or exploitability [261, 262, 263].
Previous approaches usually learned a model of the other agents as a way to predict their
behavior. However, they do not explicitly account for anticipated learning of the other agents, which
is the objective of Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) [64]. LOLA optimizes the
expected return after the opponent updates its policy one step. Therefore, a LOLA agent directly
shapes the policy updates of other agents to maximize its own reward. One of LOLA’s assumptions
is having access to opponents’ policy parameters. LOLA builds on previous ideas by Zhang and
Lesser [264] where the learning agent predicts the opponent’s policy parameter update but only
uses it to learn a best response (to the anticipated updated parameters).
Theory of mind is part of a group of recursive reasoning approaches[265, 245, 266, 267] in
which agents have explicit beliefs about the mental states of other agents. The mental states
of other agents may, in turn, also contain beliefs and mental states of other agents, leading to
a nesting of beliefs [11]. Theory of Mind Network (ToMnet) [174] starts with a simple premise:
when encountering a novel opponent, the agent should already have a strong and rich prior about
how the opponent should behave. ToMnet has an architecture composed of three networks: (i) a
character network that learns from historical information, (ii) a mental state network that takes the
character output and the recent trajectory, and (iii) the prediction network that takes the current
state as well as the outputs of the other networks as its input. The output of the architecture
is open for different problems but in general its goal is to predict the opponent’s next action. A
main advantage of ToMnet is that it can predict general behavior, for all agents; or specific, for a
particular agent.
Deep Bayesian Theory of Mind Policy (Bayes-ToMoP) [175] is another algorithm that takes
inspiration from theory of mind [268]. The algorithm assumes the opponent has different stationary
15
Johanson et al. [254] also found “overfitting” when solving large extensive games (e.g., poker) — the performance
in an abstract game improved but it was worse in the full game.

24

strategies to act and changes among them over time [269]. Earlier work in MAL dealt with
this setting, e.g., BPR+ [270] extends the Bayesian policy reuse16 framework [271] to multiagent
settings (BPR assumes a single-agent environment; BPR+ aims to best respond to the opponent
in a multiagent game). A limitation of BPR+ is that it behaves poorly against itself (self-play),
thus, Deep Bayes-ToMoP uses theory of mind to provide a higher-level reasoning strategy which
provides an optimal behavior against BPR+ agents.
Deep BPR+ [184] is another work inspired by BPR+ which uses neural networks as valuefunction approximators. It not only uses the environment reward but also uses the online learned
opponent model [272, 273] to construct a rectified belief over the opponent strategy. Additionally, it
leverages ideas from policy distillation [227, 228] and extends them to the multiagent case to create a
distilled policy network. In this case, whenever a new acting policy is learned, distillation is applied
to consolidate the new updated library which improves in terms of storage and generalization (over
opponents).
4. Bridging RL, MAL and MDRL
This section aims to provide directions to promote fruitful cooperations between sub-communities.
First, we address the pitfall of deep learning amnesia, roughly described as missing citations to
the original works and not exploiting the advancements that have been made in the past. We
present examples on how ideas originated earlier, for example in RL and MAL, were successfully
extended to MDRL (see Section 4.1). Second, we outline lessons learned from the works analyzed
in this survey (see Section 4.2). Then we point the readers to recent benchmarks for MDRL (see
Section 4.3) and we discuss the practical challenges that arise in MDRL like high computational
demands and reproducibility (see Section 4.4). Lastly, we pose some open research challenges and
reflect on their relation with previous open questions in MAL [11] (see Section 4.5).
4.1. Avoiding deep learning amnesia: examples in MDRL
This survey focuses on recent deep works, however, in previous sections, when describing recent
algorithms, we also point to original works that inspired them. Schmidhuber said “Machine learning
is the science of credit assignment. The machine learning community itself profits from proper
credit assignment to its members” [274]. In this context, we want to avoid committing the pitfall
of not giving credit to original ideas that were proposed earlier, a.k.a. deep learning amnesia.
Here, we provide some specific examples of research milestones that were studied earlier, e.g., RL
or MAL, and that now became highly relevant for MDRL. Our purpose is to highlight that existent
literature contains pertinent ideas and algorithms that should not be ignored. On the contrary,
they should be examined and cited [275, 276] to understand recent developments [277].
Dealing with non-stationarity in independent learners. It is well known that using independent
learners makes the environment non-stationary from the agent’s point of view [4, 123]. Many MAL
algorithms tried to solve this problem in different ways [10]. One example is Hyper-Q [150] which
accounts for the (values of mixed) strategies of other agents and includes that information in the
state representation, which effectively turns the learning problem into a stationary one. Note that in
16
Bayesian policy reuse assumes an agent with prior experience in the form of a library of policies. When a novel
task instance occurs, the objective is to reuse a policy from its library based on observed signals which correlate to
policy performance [271].

25

this way it is possible to even consider adaptive agents. Foerster et al. [162] make use of this insight
to propose their fingerprint algorithm in an MDRL problem (see Section 3.5). Other examples
include the leniency concept [222] and Hysteretic Q-learning [8] originally presented in MAL, which
now have their “deep” counterparts, LDQNs [35] and DEC-HDRQNs[166], see Section 3.5.
Multiagent credit assignment. In cooperative multiagent scenarios, it is common to use either
local rewards, unique for each agent, or global rewards, which represent the entire group’s performance [278]. However, local rewards are usually harder to obtain, therefore, it is common to rely
only on the global ones. This raises the problem of credit assignment: how does a single agent’s actions contribute to a system that involves the actions of many agents [32]. A solution that came from
MAL research that has proven successful in many scenarios is difference rewards [241, 278, 279],
which aims to capture an agent’s contribution to the system’s global performance. In particular
the aristocrat utility aims to measure the difference between an agents actual action and the average action [31], however, it has a self-consistency problem and in practice it is more common
to compute the wonderful life utility [280, 31], which proposes to use a clamping operation that
would be equivalent to removing that player from the team. COMA [167] builds on these concepts
to propose an advantage function based on the contribution of the agent, which can be efficiently
computed with deep neural networks (see Section 3.5).
Multitask learning. In the context of RL, multitask learning [226] is an area that develops agents
that can act in several related tasks rather than just in a single one [281]. Distillation, roughly
defined as transferring the knowledge from a large model to a small model, was a concept originally
introduced for supervised learning and model compression [282, 228]. Inspired by those works,
Policy distillation [227] was extended to the DRL realm. Policy distillation was used to train a much
smaller network and to merge several task-specific policies into a single policy, i.e., for multitask
learning. In the MDRL setting, Omidshafiei et al. [166] successfully adapted policy distillation
within Dec-HDRQNs to obtain a more general multitask multiagent network (see Section 3.5).
Another example is Deep BPR+ [184] which uses distillation to generalize over multiple opponents
(see Section 3.6).
Auxiliary tasks. Jaderberg et al. [84] introduced the term auxiliary task with the insight that
(single-agent) environments contain a variety of possible training signals (e.g., pixel changes). These
tasks are naturally implemented in DRL in which the last layer is split into multiple parts (heads),
each working on a different task. All heads propagate errors into the same shared preceding part
of the network, which would then try to form representations, in its next-to-last layer, to support
all the heads [20]. However, the idea of multiple predictions about arbitrary signals was originally
suggested for RL, in the context of general value functions [110, 20] and there still open problems,
for example, better theoretical understanding [109, 283]. In the context of neural networks, early
work proposed hints that improved the network performance and learning time. Suddarth and
Kergosien [284] presented a minimal example of a small neural network where it was shown that
adding an auxiliary task effectively removed local minima. One could think of extending these
auxiliary tasks to modeling other agents’ behaviors [285, 160], which is one of the key ideas that
DPIQN and DRPIQN [171] proposed in MDRL settings (see Section 3.6).
Experience replay. Lin [90, 89] proposed the concept of experience replay to speed up the credit
assignment propagation process in single agent RL. This concept became central to many DRL
works [72] (see Section 2.2). However, Lin stated that a condition for the ER to be useful is
26

that “the environment should not change over time because this makes past experiences irrelevant
or even harmful” [90]. This is a problem in domains where many agents are learning since the
environment becomes non-stationary from the point of view of each agent. Since DRL relies
heavily on experience replay, this is an issue in MDRL: the non-stationarity introduced means that
the dynamics that generated the data in the agent’s replay memory no longer reflect the current
dynamics in which it is learning [162]. To overcome this problem different methods have been
proposed [168, 35, 166, 178], see Section 4.2.
Double estimators. Double Q-learning [91] proposed to reduce the overestimation of action values
in Q-learning, this is caused by using the maximum action value as an approximation for the
maximum expected action value. Double Q-learning works by keeping two Q functions and was
proven to convergence to the optimal policy [91]. Later this idea was applied to arbitrary function
approximators, including deep neural networks, i.e., Double DQN [92], which were naturally applied
since two networks were already used in DQN (see Section 2.2). These ideas have also been recently
applied to MDRL [178].
4.2. Lessons learned
We have exemplified how RL and MAL can be extended for MDRL settings. Now, we outline
general best practices learned from the works analyzed throughout this paper.
• Experience replay buffer in MDRL. While some works removed the ER buffer in MDRL [162]
it is an important component in many DRL and MDRL algorithms. However, using the
standard buffer (i.e., keeping hs, a, r, s0 i) will probably fail due to a lack of theoretical guarantees under this setting, see Sections 2.2 and 4.1. Adding information in the experience
tuple that can help disambiguate the sample is the solution adopted in many works, whether
a value based method [168, 35, 166, 178] or a policy gradient method [63]. In this regard,
it is an open question to consider how new DRL ideas could be best integrated into the
ER [286, 111, 287, 288, 96] and how those ideas would fare in a MDRL setting.
• Centralized learning with decentralized execution. Many MAL works were either fully centralized or fully decentralized approaches. However, inspired by decentralized partially observable Markov decison processes (DEC-POMDPs) [289, 290],17 in MDRL this new mixed
paradigm has been commonly used [168, 35, 181, 172, 167, 63] (a notable exception are
DEC-HDRQNs [166] which perform learning and execution in a decentralized manner, see
Section 3.5). Note that not all real-world problems fit into this paradigm and it is more
common for robotics or games where a simulator is generally available [162]. The main benefit is that during learning additional information can be used (e.g., global state, action, or
rewards) and during execution this information is removed.
• Parameter sharing. Another frequent component in many MDRL works is the idea of sharing
parameters, i.e., training a single network in which agents share their weights. Note that, since
agents could receive different observations (e.g., in partially observable scenarios), they can
still behave differently. This method was proposed concurrently in different works [292, 162]
and later it has been successfully applied in many others [163, 164, 168, 180, 181].
17

Centralized planning and decentralized execution is also a standard paradigm for multiagent planning [291].

cooperative-competitive domain with four agents, Pommerman. For more MDRL benchmarks see Section 4.3.

• Recurrent networks. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enhanced neural networks with a
memory capability, however, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which renders them inefficient for long-term dependencies [293]. However, RNN variants such as
LSTMs [86, 294] and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Unit) [295] addressed this challenge. In singleagent DRL, DRQN [85] initially proposed idea of using recurrent networks in single-agent
partially observable environments. Then, Feudal Networks [229] proposed a hierarchical approach [230], multiple LSTM networks with different time-scales, i.e., the observation input
schedule is different for each LSTM network, to create a temporal hierarchy so that it can
better address the long-term credit assignment challenge for RL problems. Recently, the
use of recurrent networks has been extended to MDRL to address the challenge of partially
observability [158, 162, 164, 166, 180, 181, 170, 171, 174] for example, in FTW [179], depicted
in Figure 5 and DRPIRQN [171] depicted in Figure 6. See Section 4.4 for practical challenges
(e.g., training issues) of recurrent networks in MDRL.
• Overfitting in MAL. In single-agent RL, agents can overfit to the environment [296]. A similar
problem can occur in multiagent settings [254], agents can overfit, i.e., an agent’s policy can
easily get stuck in a local optima and the learned policy may be only locally optimal to other
agents’ current policies [183]. This has the effect of limiting the generalization of the learned
policies [172]. To reduce this problem, a solution is to have a set of policies (an ensemble)
and learn from them or best respond to the mixture of them [172, 63, 169]. Another solution
has been to robustify algorithms — a robust policy should be able to behave well even with
strategies different from its training (better generalization) [183].
4.3. Benchmarks for MDRL
Standardized environments such as the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) [297, 298] and
OpenAI Gym [299] have allowed single-agent RL to move beyond toy domains. For DRL there are
open-source frameworks that provide compact and reliable implementations of some state-of-theart DRL algorithms [300]. Even though MDRL is a recent area, there are now a number of open
sourced simulators and benchmarks to use with different characteristics, which we describe below.

28

• Fully Cooperative Multiagent Object Transporation Problems (CMOTPs)18 were originally
presented by Busoniu et al. [36] as a simple two-agent coordination problem in MAL. Palmer
et al. [35] proposed two pixel-based extensions to the original setting which include narrow
passages that test the agents’ ability to master fully-cooperative sub-tasks, stochastic rewards
and noisy observations, see Figure 7a.
• The Apprentice Firemen Game19 (inspired by the classic climb game [126]) is another twoagent pixel-based environment that simultaneously confronts learners with four pathologies
in MAL: relative overgeneralization, stochasticity, the moving target problem, and alter exploration problem [97].
• Pommerman [301] is a multiagent benchmark useful for testing cooperative, competitive
and mixed (cooperative and competitive) scenarios. It supports partial observability and
communication among agents, see Figure 7b. Pommerman is a very challenging domain
from the exploration perspective as the rewards are very sparse and delayed [302]. A recent
competition was held during NeurIPS-201820 and the top agents from that competition are
available for training purposes.
• Starcraft Multiagent Challenge [303] is based on the real-time strategy game StarCraft II
and focuses on micromanagement challenges,21 that is, fine-grained control of individual
units, where each unit is controlled by an independent agent that must act based on local
observations. It is accompanied by a MDRL framework including state-of-the-art algorithms
(e.g., QMIX and COMA).22
• The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Malmö (MARLÖ) competition [304] is another
multiagent challenge with multiple cooperative 3D games23 within Minecraft. The scenarios
were created with the open source Malmö platform [305], providing examples of how a wider
range of multiagent cooperative, competitive and mixed scenarios can be experimented on
within Minecraft.
• Hanabi is a cooperative multiplayer card game (two to five players). The main characteristic
of the game is that players do not observe their own cards but other players can reveal
information about them. This makes an interesting challenge for learning algorithms in
particular in the context of self-play learning and ad-hoc teams [306, 307, 308]. The Hanabi
Learning Environment [309] was recently released24 and it is accompanied with a baseline
(deep RL) agent [310].
• Arena [311] is platform for multiagent research25 based on the Unity engine [312]. It has 35
multiagent games (e.g., social dilemmas) and supports communication among agents. It has
basseline implementations of recent DRL algorithms such as independent PPO learners.

Multiplayer Online (MMO) Role-Playing Games. These games involve a large, variable number of players competing to survive.
4.4. Practical challenges in MDRL
In this section we take a more critical view with respect to MDRL and highlight different
practical challenges that already happen in DRL and that are likely to occur in MDRL such
as reproducibility, hyperparameter tuning, the need of computational resources and conflation of
results. We provide pointers on how we think those challenges could be (partially) addressed.
Reproducibility, troubling trends and negative results. Reproducibility is a challenge in RL which
is only aggravated in DRL due to different sources of stochasticity: baselines, hyperparameters,
architectures [315, 316] and random seeds [317]. Moreover, DRL does not have common practices
for statistical testing [318] which has led to bad practices such as only reporting the results when
algorithms perform well, sometimes referred as cherry picking [319] (Azizzadenesheli also describes
cherry planting as adapting an environment to a specific algorithm [319]). We believe that together
with following the advice on how to design experiments and report results [320], the community
would also benefit from reporting negative results [321, 322, 318, 323] for carefully designed hypothesis and experiments.28 However, we found very few papers with this characteristic[324, 325, 326]
— we note that this is not encouraged in the ML community; moreover, negative results reduce
the chance of paper acceptance [320]. In this regard, we ask the community to reflect on these
practices and find ways to remove these obstacles.
Implementation challenges and hyperparameter tuning. One problem is that canonical implementations of DRL algorithms often contain additional non-trivial optimizations — these are sometimes
necessary for the algorithms to achieve good performance [79]. A recent study by Tucker et al. [59]
found that several published works on action-dependant baselines contained bugs and errors —
those were the real reason of the high performance in the experimental results, not the proposed
method. Melis et al. [327] compared a series of works with increasing innovations in network architectures and the vanilla LSTMs [86] (originally proposed in 1997). The results showed that,
when properly tuned, LSTMs outperformed the more recent models. In this context, Lipton and
Steinhardt noted that the community may have benefited more by learning the details of the hyperparameter tuning [320]. A partial reason for this surprising result might be that this type of
networks are known for being difficult to train [293] and there are recent works in DRL that report problems when using recurrent networks [182, 328, 329, 330]. Another known complication is
catastrophic forgetting (see Section 2.2) with recent examples in DRL [157, 92] — we expect that

This idea was initially inspired by the Workshop “Critiquing and Correcting Trends in Machine Learning” at
NeurIPS 2018 where it was possible to submit Negative results papers: “Papers which show failure modes of existing
algorithms or suggest new approaches which one might expect to perform well but which do not. The aim is to
provide a venue for work which might otherwise go unpublished but which is still of interest to the community.”

these issues would likely occur in MDRL. The effects of hyperparameter tuning were analyzed in
more detail in DRL by Henderson et al. [315], who arrived at the conclusion that hyperparameters
can have significantly different effects across algorithms (they tested TRPO, DDPG, PPO and
ACKTR) and environments since there is an intricate interplay among them [315]. The authors
urge the community to report all parameters used in the experimental evaluations for accurate
comparison — we encourage a similar behavior for MDRL. Note that hyperparameter tuning is related to the troubling trend of cherry picking in that it can show a carefully picked set of parameters
that make an algorithm work (see previous challenge). Lastly, note that hyperparameter tuning
is computationally very expensive, which relates to the connection with the following challenge of
computational demands.
Computational resources. Deep RL usually requires millions of interactions for an agent to learn [331],
i.e., low sample efficiency [332], which highlights the need for large computational infrastructure
in general. The original A3C implementation [93] uses 16 CPU workers for 4 days to learn to play
an Atari game with a total of 200M training frames29 (results are reported for 57 Atari games).
Distributed PPO used 64 workers (presumably one CPU per worker, although this is not clearly
stated in the paper) for 100 hours (more than 4 days) to learn locomotion tasks [117]. In MDRL,
for example, the Atari Pong game, agents were trained for 50 epochs, 250k time steps each, for a
total of 1.25M training frames [155]. The FTW agent [179] uses 30 agents (processes) in parallel
and every training game lasts for five minues; FTW agents were trained for approximately 450K
games ≈4.2 years. These examples highlight the computational demands sometimes needed within
DRL and MDRL.
Recent works have reduced the learning of an Atari game to minutes (Stooke and Abbeel [334]
trained DRL agents in less than one hour with hardware consisting of 8 GPUs and 40 cores).
However, this is (for now) the exception and computational infrastructure is a major bottleneck
for doing DRL and MDRL, especially for those who do not have such large compute power (e.g.,
most companies and most academic research groups) [212, 322].30 Within this context we propose
two ways to address this problem. (1) Raising awareness: For DRL we found few works that study
the computational demands of recent algorithms [335, 331]. For MDRL most published works do
not provide information regarding computational resources used such as CPU/GPU usage, memory
demands, and wall-clock computation. Therefore, the first way to tackle this issue is by raising
awareness and encouraging authors to report metrics about computational demands for accurately
comparison and evaluation. (2) Delve into algorithmic contributions. Another way to address
these issues is to prioritize the algorithmic contribution for the new MDRL algorithms rather than
the computational resources spent. Indeed, for this to work, it needs to be accompanied with
high-quality reviewers.
We have argued to raise awareness on the computational demands and report results, however,
there is still the open question on how and what to measure/report. There are several dimensions
to measure efficiency: sample efficiency is commonly measured by counting state-action pairs used
for training; computational efficiency could be measured by number of CPUs/GPUs and days used
for training. How do we measure the impact of other resources, such as external data sources or
29

It is sometimes unclear in the literature what is the meaning of frame due to the “frame skip” technique. It is
therefore suggested to refer to “game frames” and “training frames” [333].
30
One recent effort by Beeching et al. [212] proposes to use only “mid-range hardware” (8 CPUs and 1 GPU) to
train deep RL agents.

31

annotations?31 Similarly, do we need to differentiate the computational needs of the algorithm
itself versus the environment it is run in? We do not have the answers, however, we point out that
current standard metrics might not be entirely comprehensive.
In the end, we believe that high compute based methods act as a frontier to showcase benchmarks [19, 18], i.e., they show what results are possible as data and compute is scaled up (e.g.,
OpenAI Five generates 180 years of gameplay data each day using 128,000 CPU cores and 256
GPUs [18]; AlphaStar uses 200 years of Starcraft II gameplay [19]); however, lighter compute based
algorithmic methods can also yield significant contributions to better tackle real-world problems.
Occam’s razor and ablative analysis. Finding the simplest context that exposes the innovative
research idea remains challenging, and if ignored leads to a conflation of fundamental research
(working principles in the most abstract setting) and applied research (working systems as complete
as possible). In particular, some deep learning papers are presented as learning from pixels without
further explanation, while object-level representations would have already exposed the algorithmic
contribution. This still makes sense to remain comparable with established benchmarks (e.g.,
OpenAI Gym [299]), but less so if custom simulations are written without open source access, as it
introduces unnecessary variance in pixel-level representations and artificially inflates computational
resources (see previous point about computational resources).32 In this context there are some
notable exceptions where the algorithmic contribution is presented in a minimal setting and then
results are scaled into complex settings: LOLA [64] first presented a minimalist setting with a twoplayer two-action game and then with a more complex variant; similarly, QMIX [181] presented its
results in a two-step (matrix) game and then in the more involved Starcraft II micromanagement
domain [303].
4.5. Open questions
Finally, here we present some open questions for MDRL and point to suggestions on how to
approach them. We believe that there are solid ideas in earlier literature and we refer the reader
to Section 4.1 to avoid deep learning amnesia.
• On the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards.
Recent MDRL competitions and environments have complex scenarios where many actions
are taken before a reward signal is available (see Section 4.3). This sparseness is already a
challenge for RL [20, 338] where approaches such as count-based exploration/intrinsic motivation [196, 339, 340, 341, 342] and hierarchical learning [343, 344, 111] have been proposed
to address it — in MDRL this is even more problematic since the agents not only need to
learn basic behaviors (like in DRL), but also to learn the strategic element (e.g., competitive/collaborative) embedded in the multiagent setting. To address this issue, recent MDRL
approaches applied dense rewards [206, 205, 204] (a concept originated in RL) at each step
to allow the agents to learn basic motor skills and then decrease these dense rewards over
31

NeurIPS 2019 hosts the “MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Human Priors”
where the primary goal of the competition is to foster the development of algorithms which can efficiently leverage
human demonstrations to drastically reduce the number of samples needed to solve complex, hierarchical, and sparse
environments [336].
32
Cuccu, Togelius and Cudré-Mauroux achieved state-of-the-art policy learning in Atari games with only 6 to 18
neurons [337]. The main idea was to decouple image processing from decision-making.

32

time in favor of the environmental reward [158], see Section 3.3. Recent works like OpenAI
Five [18] uses hand-crafted intermediate rewards to accelerate the learning and FTW [179]
lets the agents learn their internal rewards by a hierarchical two-tier optimization. In single
agent domains, RUDDER [345] has been recently proposed for such delayed sparse reward
problems. RUDDER generates a new MDP with more intermediate rewards whose optimal
solution is still an optimal solution to the original MDP. This is achieved by using LSTM
networks to redistribute the original sparse reward to earlier state-action pairs and automatically provide reward shaping. How to best extend RUDDER to multiagent domains is an
open avenue of research.
• On the role of self-play.
Self-play is a cornerstone in MAL with impressive results [147, 127, 145, 346, 143]. While
notable results had also been shown in MDRL [173, 193], recent works have also shown that
plain self-play does not yield the best results. However, adding diversity, i.e., evolutionary
methods [239, 240, 233, 234] or sampling-based methods, have shown good results [158, 179,
159]. A drawback of these solutions is the additional computational requirements since they
need either parallel training (more CPU computation) or memory requirements. Then, it is
still an open problem to improve the computational efficiency of these previously proposed
successful methods, i.e., achieving similar training stability with smaller population sizes that
uses fewer CPU workers in MAL and MDRL (see Section 4.4 and Albrecht et al. [11, Section
5.5]).
• On the challenge of the combinatorial nature of MDRL.
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) [347] has been the backbone of the major breakthroughs behind AlphaGo [14] and AlphaGo Zero [15] that combined search and DRL. A recent work [348]
has outlined how search and RL can be better combined for potentially new methods. However, for multiagent scenarios, there is an additional challenge of the exponential growth of
all the agents’ action spaces for centralized methods [349]. One way to tackle this challenge
within multiagent scenarios is the use of search parallelization [350, 351]. Given more scalable
planners, there is room for research in combining these techniques in MDRL settings.
To learn complex multiagent interactions some type of abstraction [352] is often needed, for
example, factored value functions [353, 354, 242, 243, 355, 356] (see QMIX and VDN in
Section 3.5 for recent work in MDRL) try to exploit independence among agents through
(factored) structure; however, in MDRL there are still open questions such as understanding
their representational power [244] (e.g., the accuracy of the learned Q-function approximations) and how to learn those factorizations, where ideas from transfer planning techniques
could be useful [357, 103]. In transfer planning the idea is to define a simpler “source problem” (e.g., with fewer agents), in which the agent(s) can plan [357] or learn [103]; since it
is less complex than the real multiagent problem, issues such as the non-stationarity of the
environment can be reduced/removed. Lastly, another related idea are influence abstractions [358, 359, 10], where instead of learning a complex multiagent model, these methods
try to build smaller models based on the influence agents can exert on one another. While
this has not been sufficiently explored in actual multiagent settings, there is some evidence
that these ideas can lead to effective inductive biases, improving effectiveness of DRL in such
local abstractions [360].
33

5. Conclusions
Deep reinforcement learning has shown recent success on many fronts [13, 14, 16] and a natural
next step is to test multiagent scenarios. However, learning in multiagent environments is fundamentally more difficult due to non-stationarity, the increase of dimensionality, and the creditassignment problem, among other factors [1, 5, 10, 147, 241, 361, 97].
This survey provides broad overview of recent works in the emerging area of Multiagent Deep
Reinforcement Learning (MDRL). First, we categorized recent works into four different topics:
emergent behaviors, learning communication, learning cooperation, and agents modeling agents.
Then, we exemplified how key components (e.g., experience replay and difference rewards) originated in RL and MAL need to be adapted to work in MDRL. We provided general lessons learned
applicable to MDRL, pointed to recent multiagent benchmarks and highlighted some open research
problems. Finally, we also reflected on the practical challenges such as computational demands
and reproducibility in MDRL.
Our conclusions of this work are that while the number of works in DRL and MDRL are
notable and represent important milestones for AI, at the same time we acknowledge there are also
open questions in both (deep) single-agent learning [38, 298, 362, 79] and multiagent learning [363,
364, 365, 366, 367, 368]. Our view is that there are practical issues within MDRL that hinder
its scientific progress: the necessity of high compute power, complicated reproducibility (e.g.,
hyperparameter tuning), and the lack of sufficient encouragement for publishing negative results.
However, we remain highly optimistic of the multiagent community and hope this work serves to
raise those issues, encounter good solutions, and ultimately take advantage of the existing literature
and resources available to move the area in the right direction.
