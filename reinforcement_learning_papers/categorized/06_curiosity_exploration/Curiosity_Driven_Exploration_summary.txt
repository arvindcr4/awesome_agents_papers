**TITLE:** Is Curiosity All You Need? On the Utility of Emergent Behaviours from Curious Exploration
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 06_curiosity_exploration
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper proposes a curiosity-based exploration method called SelMo, which optimizes a curiosity objective in an off-policy fashion. The method uses a forward dynamics model to predict the next state and assigns a reward based on the prediction error. The policy is optimized using maximum a posteriori policy optimization (MPO) and a separate learning rate.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper introduces SelMo, a self-motivated, curiosity-based method for exploration.
* The method is applied to two robotic manipulation and locomotion domains in simulation.
* The paper shows that diverse and meaningful behavior emerges solely based on the optimization of the curiosity objective.
* The paper proposes to extend the focus in the application of curiosity learning towards the identification and retention of emerging intermediate behaviors.
* The paper demonstrates the benefits of using self-discovered behaviors as auxiliary skills in a hierarchical reinforcement learning setup.
