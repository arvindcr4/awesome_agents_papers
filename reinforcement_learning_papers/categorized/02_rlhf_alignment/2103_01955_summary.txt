**TITLE**: The Surprising Effectiveness of PPO in Cooperative Multi-Agent Games
**ARXIV_ID**: 2103.01955v4
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 02_rlhf_alignment (although the paper is more focused on the effectiveness of PPO in cooperative multi-agent settings, it can be related to RLHF alignment)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: The paper studies the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in cooperative multi-agent settings. PPO is a ubiquitous on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that is less utilized than off-policy learning algorithms in multi-agent settings. The authors demonstrate that PPO achieves strong results in both final returns and sample efficiency that are comparable to state-of-the-art methods on a variety of cooperative multi-agent challenges.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* The paper shows that PPO achieves surprisingly strong performance in cooperative multi-agent settings, comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
* The authors identify and analyze five key implementation and hyperparameter factors that are influential in PPO's performance in these settings.
* The paper provides concrete suggestions for best practices with respect to these factors.
* The authors demonstrate that PPO can be a competitive baseline for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks.
