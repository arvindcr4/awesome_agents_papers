A BSTRACT
State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for various tasks.
However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for humans requires careful consideration.
A promising approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages
human feedback to update the model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like
toxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely entangled with initial
design choices that popularized the method and current research focuses on augmenting those choices
rather than fundamentally improving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the
lens of reinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its fundamentals, dedicating
substantial focus to the core component of RLHF—the reward model. Our study investigates
modeling choices, caveats of function approximation, and their implications on RLHF training
algorithms, highlighting the underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our
analysis improves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their training,
concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We characterize these limitations,
including incorrect generalization, model misspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with
their impact on the performance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated
by a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for researchers and practitioners to
understand the challenges of RLHF and build upon existing efforts.

Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities that extend beyond basic language tasks, leading
to their widespread adoption across various industries. The remarkable utility of these models holds the potential to
transform established workflows in critical sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance, and education [Singhal et al.
2022; Wu et al. 2023a; Yan et al. 2023]. As they become integral to these domains, it’s crucial to ensure that the behavior
of LLMs is predictable, safe, and trustworthy—–meeting the expectations set for a human performing the same tasks.
This challenge of making LLMs exhibit human-like qualities, known as alignment with human objectives, is central to
making these models suitable for diverse tasks. An effective method for addressing this challenge is reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF).
RLHF first gained popularity due to its ability to solve reinforcement learning (RL) problems like simulated robotic
locomotion and playing Atari games [Christiano et al. 2017] without access to a reward function, by simply leveraging
human feedback about preferences on demonstrated behaviors. It has since been adopted for fine-tuning LLMs using
human feedback. This leads to a natural inquiry: How can a method designed to master games be effectively used
to align LLMs with human objectives? The method has proven to be immensely successful [OpenAI 2022], but not
without well-documented limitations [Casper et al. 2023]. A comprehensive understanding of why it achieves its success
remains largely elusive. Consequently, research efforts on the topic are stuck in a local minima, with variants focused
on augmenting the components of the method—including the training algorithm [Ramamurthy et al. 2022], reward
model [Wu et al. 2023c], and even RL-free approaches [Rafailov et al. 2023]. However, some fundamental limitations
of the approach remain obscured due to the overarching goal of recent work to refine the initial design choices.
In this work, we develop a comprehensive understanding of RLHF by analyzing the core components of the method. We
begin the study by motivating the necessity for RLHF by highlighting the problem of objective mismatch in pre-trained
LMs (Section 2). To formulate foundational questions about the framework, we adopt a Bayesian perspective of RLHF.
It serves to highlight the significance of the reward function in particular (Section 4). The reward function forms the
central cog of the RLHF procedure, and the design choices used to model it form a major focus of our study.
The current formulation of RLHF relies on a set of assumptions to model the reward function (Section 4.1, 4.2).
Following the delineation of these assumptions, an analysis of the reward model independent of specific modeling
choices follows. The analysis, in a principled manner, provides an understanding of issues such as:
1. The impractical requirement for extensive amounts of feedback data for training accurate reward models.
2. The combination of very limited feedback data and the use of function approximation results in misgeneralization, wherein inaccurate reward values are assigned to inputs not seen during training.
These imperfections of the reward model, along with challenges such as reward sparsity and reward model misspecification, are highlighted in the paper (Section 5.1). Their impact on the performance of a language model is explored in
detail (Section 6.2). The course of the analysis leads to the formalization of concepts such as an oracular reward that
serve as the theoretical golden standard for future efforts (Section 4.1). An overview of the RLHF procedure along with
the various challenges studied in this work is provided in Figure 1.

The discussion is followed by an extensive survey of an expanding body of literature related to the topic. The survey is
organized into sections that outline the framework of RLHF. Starting with a high-level overview of Large Language
Models (LLMs), the survey systematically covers various aspects:
• Different types of human (and non-human) feedback (Section 7.3),
• The training methods in RLHF (Section 7.6),
• Alternative approaches that do not rely on RL or reward models (Section 7.9).
This structure aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the extensive landscape of works that have contributed to
the remarkable success of RLHF.

Motivation: Eliminating Objective Mismatch in Pre-Trained Language Models

Large pre-trained language models (PLMs) are massive neural networks that are trained on a huge corpus of texts
using a self-supervised learning objective. Originally utilized for representation learning [Devlin et al. 2019; Liu et al.
2019] with encoder-only models, recent research, particularly influenced by Brown et al. [2020], has shifted its focus
towards training PLMs to directly generate answers for textual problems. State-of-the-art PLMs typically employ an
auto-regressive transformer architecture [Vaswani et al. 2017] and are trained with a causal language modeling objective.
These models implicitly capture a conditional probability distribution πθ , reflecting the likelihood of sampling the next
token after observing a sequence of previous tokens. The probability of a text sequence x := (x1 , . . . , xT ), under this
QT −1
model is denoted as Pr(x; πθ ) = t=1 πθ (xt+1 | xt , . . . , x1 ). The model is trained to estimate the pre-training data
generating probability distribution over text sequences by minimizing the (forward) KL divergence between the model’s
data-generating distribution and the pre-training data distribution, denoted by Ppre-train (·).
min DKL (Ppre-train (x) || Pr(x; πθ )) = min Ex∼Ppre-train [log Ppre-train (x)] − Ex∼Ppre-train [log Pr(x; πθ )].

The first term, representing the entropy of Ppre-train , is independent of θ and can be disregarded during optimization.
Consequently, the objective simplifies to the following cross-entropy minimization form:
min −Ex∼Ppre-train [log Pr(x; πθ )].

The expectation is approximated using samples from an unsupervised pretraining text corpus D, which comprises text
sequences sampled from Ppre-train . This leads us to the following objective:

The remarkable property about PLMs lies in the contrast between the simplicity of the training recipe and the remarkable
results that they deliver [Brown et al. 2020]. Simply capturing language statistics along with scaling up the number of
trainable parameters, endows PLMs with robust semantic representations, vast commonsense knowledge, and strong
pattern-following capabilities. However, for adopting PLMs to assist humans with tasks that require an understanding
of human intentions and the ability to follow instructions, the simple training recipe of PLMs is insufficient. These
models demonstrate a shallow understanding of human intentions, often generating undesirable outputs, including
incorrect facts or conveying biased and toxic opinions.
Fundamentally, PLMs suffer from an objective mismatch problem: the training-time objective of capturing language
statistics does not necessarily align with the deployment-time objective of fulfilling a human user’s specific goals.
Eliminating this mismatch at first glance seems feasible: just train PLMs to optimize for the user objective. Unfortunately,
for many tasks, it is impossible to express the user objective as an optimization target. For example, when a user’s
objective pertains to eliciting humorous responses, establishing specific criteria for objectively evaluating the humor in
a generated response becomes an inherently challenging task.
There are currently two primary ways to deal with the problem: the behaviorist approach and the cognition-driven
approach. The behaviorist approach, implemented by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), aims to replicate observable
behaviors that humans perceive as desirable without explicit consideration of the underlying user objective. For instance,
if a user desires good summaries of articles, this approach trains a model to imitate examples of good summaries
without explicitly defining the criteria for a good summary. In contrast, the cognition-driven approach, implemented
by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), aims to uncover the underlying user objective that governs
4

the observed behaviors. It then updates the model by optimizing the uncovered objective. This approach relies on
certain assumptions—which in the case of RLHF are: (i) the user objective can bear the form of a reward function,
which can assign a numerical score to behaviors of the model, and (ii) this function can be approximated by a machine
learning model (e.g., a neural network). RLHF estimates this reward function and updates the PLM via reinforcement
learning to optimize for rewards. Regardless of the approach, the process of addressing the objective mismatch problem
is commonly referred to as the fine-tuning or alignment process. Presently, state-of-the-art language models typically
initiate this process with the behaviorist approach, followed by the cognition-driven approach.
2.1

Bayesian Interpretation of RLHF

RLHF relies on observing human feedback to deduce the (latent) user reward function. Human feedback is provided
on the outputs from a language model. RLHF assumes that there exists an underlying human reward function that
governs the feedback they provide in a particular manner, i.e., there exists some mapping from reward to actions of
a human. Suppose the reward function is being inferred by a model Rϕ parameterized by ϕ. Adopting a Bayesian
inference perspective [Korbak et al. 2022], the parameters ϕ can be viewed as a hypothesis with the dataset of human
feedback DHF as the evidence for this hypothesis. Given a prior distribution over the hypothesis Pr(ϕ), we can apply
Bayes’ rule to derive the posterior distribution over the hypotheses after observing the evidence as:
Pr(ϕ | DHF ) ∝ Pr(DHF | Rϕ ) Pr(ϕ)

(4)

Reward modeling in RLHF can be seen as computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the parameters of a
reward model,
ϕMAP = arg max Pr(ϕ | DHF ) = arg max Pr(DHF | Rϕ ) Pr(ϕ)
ϕ

(b)

The first term (a) is the log-likelihood of the feedback dataset, specifying how a human’s internal objective (reward
function) governs their feedback. The second term (b) represents constraints on the hypothesis space, which is enforced
through explicit and implicit regularization techniques in neural-network training.
The presented framework raises two major questions:
1. What is the form of the likelihood function Pr(DHF | Rϕ )? In other words, how do we mathematically model
the influence of a human’s latent objective on their observable feedback?
2. What is the reinforcement learning algorithm used for optimizing the reward model? In other words, how do
we ensure the model acts consistently with its objective?
A set of answers to these questions forms the basis for an RLHF algorithm. The RLHF methodology, popularized by
Christiano et al. [2017], employs pairwise ranking feedback and uses the Bradley-Terry model [Bradley and Terry 1952]
as the likelihood function. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al. 2017] is elected as the reinforcement
learning algorithm.
Before we move into the analysis of this method, we urge the readers to take a moment to reflect on the choices
and assumptions we have made so far to derive the general recipe of RLHF. Are there alternative choices? Can the
assumptions be relaxed or improved? Thinking critically about these foundational decisions is the key to understanding
the strengths and weaknesses of RLHF algorithms and innovating them. For example, the recently proposed direct
preference optimization (DPO) approach [Rafailov et al. 2023] replaces reinforcement learning with a reformulation of
the objective. Next, we formalize the problem setup of text generation as an agent interacting with a sequential decision
process, laying the foundation for the analysis of RLHF. We refer the reader to Section 7.6 for a detailed outline of the
RLHF procedure, and Figure 5 for a summarized overview.

Formulation: Text Generation as Sequential Decision-Making

In this section, we formulate the text generation procedure from a language model as a sequential decision-making
process. This formulation is essential for constructing reinforcement learning algorithms.
Markov decision process. A common framework for modeling sequential decision-making processes is Markov
Decision Process (MDP) [Markov 1954]. An MDP is defined as a tuple (S, A, p, R, ρ) where S is the set of states,
A is the set of actions, p : S × A → ∆(S) is the transition function, R : S × A → R is the reward function,
and ρ : S → ∆(S) is the initial state distribution. Each sequential time step of the process is denoted by t, and

Figure 2: Text generation from LLMs modeled as a Markov decision process. The generation process is auto-regressive,
utilizing the token output (action) from the previous time step and the context (state) as input to produce the next token
through the language model (policy). Given a context c, the language model produces the token o1 at the first timestep.
A concatenation of the two [c, o1 ] forms the input to the policy at the next timestep (Table 1). A reward function scores
the generated output for a given context.

st , at , rt denote the values of the state, action, and reward at time step t. A discounting factor γ ∈ (0, 1] is defined for
discounting rewards over time, particularly useful for modeling an MDP with an infinite number of time steps (i.e., an
infinite-horizon MDP). However, the outputs of language models are truncated after a finite number of steps. We use T
to denote the maximum time step.
An agent acts in an MDP using a policy π : S → ∆(A). The agent starts in state s1 ∼ ρ(·). At time step t, it chooses
an action at ∼ π( · | st ), executes the action, transitions to a new state st+1 ∼ p( · | st , at ), and receives a reward
rt = R(st , at ). The term “Markov” in MDP refers to the Markov property, in that the distribution over the next state
st+1 depends on only the current state st and action at .
Language models as agents in MDP. For simplicity, we consider text generation tasks that include only one turn of
interaction between the user and the model. We make a distinction between the text that a user inputs into the model,
denoted by c and referred to as the context or the prompt, and the text that the model generates by itself to the context,
denoted by o and referred to as the output or simply the generated text.
Let V be the set of all tokens that the model can generate (the vocabulary), C the set of all possible contexts, and
O the set of all possible outputs. Given a context c ∈ C as input, the model generates an output o ∈ O token by
token. Specifically, let ot be the t-th token in generated output o, then the model parameterized by θ first outputs token
o1 ∼ πθ ( · | c), and then conditioned on the concatenation of o1 and c it generates o2 ∼ πθ ( · | [c, o1 ]), and so on.
We can see that this generation process resembles an agent traversing in an MDP (Figure 2). The model acts according
to a policy πθ . The start-state distribution ρ is the distribution over user-provided contexts. The action space is the
vocabulary V . The action at is the generated token ot . The state st is the concatenation of the context c and all the
tokens the model has generated up to time step t − 1. The transition function p( · | st , at ) = δ([st , at ]) is a delta
distribution, i.e., the next state is deterministic given the current state and action. Reward rt given at time step t is
computed by the reward model as Rϕ (st , at ) which is either a human or a function learned from human feedback.
The text generation MDP has several special properties:
1. The action space is extremely large. For example, the LLaMa model [Touvron et al. 2023a,b] employs a
vocabulary of size 32K. Having a gigantic action space blows up the search space for reinforcement learning
algorithms.
2. The structure of the state space is complex, as a state is essentially a text sequence. Pre-training on large
amounts of texts is necessary to learn an initially good representation of this space.

3. The initial state distribution has an enormous support. All conceivable contexts lie in the support, thus strongly
testing the ability of the policy to generalize to out-of-distribution states.
4. The reward function used for training can differ from the evaluation reward function. This is because the
humans providing rewards during evaluation may be different from the humans involved in trainnig the reward
model. Analogous to transfer learning in RL, the agent must then adapt to the new reward function.
5. The transition function is deterministic. Algorithmic and analysis tools tailored for deterministic MDPs can be
applied.
Thus, solving a text generation MDP requires specialized treatment that takes advantage of its properties and overcomes
its inherent challenges. Reinforcement learning [Sutton and Barto 2018; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis 1996] provides
solutions for optimally solving an MDP, i.e., learning a policy that maximizes the accumulated reward. Consequently,
RLHF updates the language model to generate more rewarding outputs. Naturally, the reward function plays a critical
role in the process of fine-tuning model outputs, determining practical and fundamental limits [Casper et al. 2023] of
the efficacy of RLHF.

4

The Role of Reward

The goal of reward learning in RLHF is to convert human feedback into an optimizable reward function. The reward
serves a dual purpose: it encodes the task information (for example, identical input-output pairs would receive distinct
rewards depending on whether the task involved summarization or text expansion) 1 as well as preferences over those
outputs (a condescending summary is rewarded less than a neutral summary). The reward thus encodes relevant
information for measuring (Section 4.3) as well as inducing alignment with human objectives. By setting the reward
function of the sequential decision process to the one estimated from human feedback Rϕ , reinforcement learning
algorithms can be used to learn a language model policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, resulting in an aligned
language model.
4.1

Oracular Reward and the Role of Human Feedback

An implicit assumption made in RLHF is that a human’s feedback behavior is governed by and can be represented as
an oracular reward function R⋆ : C × O → R. We assume that this function is deterministic in line with the current
methodology. The function takes as input a context c and an output o, and outputs a scalar number reflecting the
preference on o as a continuation of c. Because the [c, o] is essentially a state in the MDP formulation, the reward function
is essentially defined over states of the MDP. The language model that maximizes the oracular reward accurately
reflects the goals and preferences inherent in the human feedback, and maximization of this reward consequently aligns
the model with the human preferences. The oracular reward may not be accessible or learnable, but under the reward
hypothesis [Sutton 2004; Silver et al. 2021], the mere existence of such a reward may be assumed—though this may be
challenged [Knox et al. 2022]. The oracular reward forms the golden standard for training as well as evaluating any
language model.
In general, humans can give a variety of feedback. RLHF operates with feedback that discloses information about the
oracular reward function. Most methods focus on two types of feedback: point-wise numerical feedback (or rating),
and pairwise ranking feedback (or preferences). Providing ratings is the most straightforward way to communicate
the reward function. Given a pair (c, o), the rating is a scalar r = R⋆ (c, o). While ratings can be fed directly into a
1

Unless the task is specified in the input prompt itself, in which case the inputs differ.

7

reinforcement learning algorithm, learning a reward model takes advantage of the generalizability of the reward model
on unseen outputs and contexts.
Preference feedback compares two outputs generated for the same context. Given two outputs o and o′ generated for
context c, a human denoted a preference o ≻ o′ if the first input is preferred and o′ ≻ o otherwise. Preferences in their
raw form are not compatible learning signals for reinforcement learning algorithms. Hence, a reward model must be
learned for this type of feedback. To do so, an assumption must be made about the relationship between preferences
and R⋆ . We will discuss this in more detail in the next section. A discussion about the various methodologies used
for encoding preferences can be found in Section 7.5. An alternative approach for ranking outputs on the basis of
preferences is provided by the learning-to-rank paradigm [Liu et al. 2009].
Using preference feedback offers several advantages compared to using ratings. Firstly, we get more training data for
the reward model. In practice, people collect a ranking of N outputs and create preference pairs [Ouyang et al. 2022].
Collecting N ratings for N outputs provides we get N training points. Ranking N outputs provided N (N − 1)/2
pairwise comparisons. Second, preferences require assigning a only relative order rather than an absolute precise score
to an output; the latter task could take significantly more cognitive effort and is more prone to inconsistency. Finally, a
preference is presumably easier to provide because it offers a “baseline” for comparison (the worse output). In contrast,
when giving a rating, a human can rely on only the evaluation guidelines.
A note on stochastic rewards: The reward function is considered to be a deterministic mapping from text to a scalar
value. This amounts to averaging the preferences of all humans that provided human feedback. Moreover, it assumes
that a human must always rate an input-output pair with the same score, discounting the inherent variability of human
preferences. There are numerous scenarios—like personalization, in-context adaptation to ongoing dialogue, and
diverse output generation—where a deterministic mapping is limiting. The rewards are more appropriately modeled as
being stochastic, wherein each input-output pair is scored by a distribution over scalar rewards, say r ∼ Rhuman (· | c, o).
This modeling accounts for the two sources of uncertainty: (i) uncertainty over the specific human from a group of
humans who provide feedback, and (ii) variability in a human’s preferences due to changes in unobserved factors
[Nguyen et al. 2017]. Some work in reinforcement learning aims to address this by learning Bayesian preferences,
primarily for uncertainty quantification and safety analysis [Ramachandran and Amir 2007; Brown and Niekum 2019],
and can be adapted to model a distribution of preferences over text. Some recent efforts along these lines [Barnett et al.
2023] have proven to be effective. We focus on deterministic rewards for the analysis that follows.
4.2

Reward Modeling

Learning a reward model serves two purposes: (i) to convert RLHF into a canonical reinforcement learning problem,
and (ii) to reduce the cost of online feedback-collection. Reinforcement learning algorithms define their objective in
terms of a reward function. To apply these algorithms, we need to infer a reward function from a feedback dataset,
collecting which is notoriously expensive. Currently, large language models require thousands to millions of feedback
data points. To gather that amount, many human evaluators need to be recruited to work in parallel. To ensure the
assumptions regarding the oracular reward function hold, the evaluators must be trained to agree with one another
on the evaluation criteria. This process is continual: multiple rounds of feedback collections need to be conducted to
iteratively improve the model. The premise of approaches that learn a reward model is that the generalization error of
the reward model is expected to decrease faster than that of the policy as a function of the number of labeled data points,
arising from the notion that supervised learning is often considered a simpler problem than generative modeling.
Following the previous section, we denote the reward model by Rϕ (c, o) and the feedback dataset by DHF . Our goal is
to decide a likelihood function Pr(DHF | ϕ) and find ϕ that maximizes this function:
max Pr(DHF | ϕ)
ϕ

(6)

With rating feedback, the reward-modeling problem can be formulated as a prediction problem with continuous output.
A common objective for this type of problem is the minimization of the mean squared error (MSE):
X

(Rϕ (c, o) − r)2

(c,o,r)∈DHF

To incorporate preference feedback, we need to choose the form of the likelihood function denoting each preference,
i.e., Pr((o ≻ o′ , c) | ϕ). The RLHF method of Ouyang et al. [2022] employs the Bradley-Terry model to represent the
likelihood of a data point:
Pr((o ≻ o′ , c) | ϕ) =

exp(Rϕ (c, o))
exp(Rϕ (c, o)) + exp(Rϕ (c, o′ ))

where σ(x) = 1+e1−x is the sigmoid function. The learning objective for maximizing the log-likelihood of the dataset

In Section 5, we further generalize the form of feedback and the likelihood function to conduct an analysis independent
of the specifics of particular design choices.

Measuring Alignment

Evaluation of natural language tasks is a difficult problem, and the study of evaluation metrics is an active area of
research. Of particular importance, and difficulty, is to measure the alignment of a language model to a human’s
objectives, which in practice is evaluated along the axes of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. The oracular reward
that governs a human’s preferences serves as a yardstick for measuring the degree of alignment. The task of alignment
is then reformulated as encoding the preferences demonstrated by a human into a reward function, and updating the
parameters of the language model to produce output that maximizes this reward.
A reward provides an analytical metric to measure the overall performance of a language model π, where the performance
captures the degree of alignment with human preferences along with the degree of satisfaction of the task itself [Ngo
et al. 2022]. The performance of a model π, for distribution over contexts dC (·), can be measured by averaging the
rewards for the outputs generated by π given the contexts. Let the performance be denoted by J(π):
XX


J(π) :=
dC (c)π(o | c)R⋆ (c, o) = Ec∼dC (·) EO∼π(·|c) [R⋆ (c, O)|C = c]
(12)
c

o

The context distribution dC (·) can be the distribution of contexts in the training data, test data, or a held-out validation
dataset, depending on the data on which the performance of the model is being evaluated. The sequential nature of the
output generation equivalently allows us to express J(π) as:
"

J(π) := Eπ
R (st , at ) = Eπ
R (c, o1:t−1 , ot ) =
Eπ [R⋆ (c, o1:t−1 , ot )]
(13)
t

In practice, most current reward models only provide a reward after the complete output has been generated and
Equation 13 reduces to Equation 12. The definition of J(π) uses the oracular reward that is not accessible in practice.
An estimate of the performance can obtained from the estimated reward Rϕ , by plugging it into Equation 12:


b
J(π)
:= Ec∼dC (·) EO∼π(·|c) [Rϕ (c, O)|C = c]
(14)
The pre-trained language model is denoted by πpre : C → ∆(O) and the model updated using RLHF by πrlhf : C →
∆(O). The goal of RLHF is to update the parameters of πrlhf such that J(πrlhf ) ≥ J(πpre ), i.e., as evaluated using the
b rlhf ) ≥ J(π
b pre ), which may be non-informative when
oracular reward. In practice, it is only possible to verify that J(π
the estimated reward model Rϕ has inaccuracies for the context-output pairs being evaluated (Section 6.2).

Inferring the Reward from Human Feedback

In the following sections, we study the properties of the reward estimated from human feedback. As reviewed in Section
7.5, various procedures exist for encoding human feedback into a reward model. Both the form of human feedback
and the encoding mechanism continue to be studied further, with the procedures continually evolving and improving.
Currently, the most common form of human feedback is pair-wise preference feedback that is encoded into a reward
according to the Bradley-Terry model (Section 4.2). To perform an analysis agnostic to specifics of a particular reward
learning method,
1. Let feedback denote a general form of sufficiently informative feedback.
2. Let Ω denote the model of human behavior, or the encoding mechanism, that maps the feedback and the text to
a reward value.
9

The generality of this formulation allows the following analysis to cover all existing RLHF-style approaches (for
example, RLAIF [Bai et al. 2022b]) as well as future methods for fine-tuning LLMs, that employ a reward model.
Let D := {(c, o) : c ∈ C, o ∈ O} denote a hypothetical dataset of all possible contexts and outputs that a language
model can encounter, i.e., a humongous dataset of size |C| × |O| = |V |T . This dataset cannot be realized in practice and
is invoked to shed light on the practical limitations of the existing methodology. Denote the dataset of collected human
feedback by DHF := {(c, o, feedback) : c ∈ CHF , o ∈ OHF } where CHF ⊂ C, OHF ⊂ O are the subsets of contextoutput pairs (human-)annotated with feedback.2 The reward encoding mechanism that maps context-output pairs
along human feedback to rewards (for instance, the Bradley-Terry model) is denoted by Ω : (c, o, feedback) → R.3
To uncover R⋆ , it is assumed that Ω accurately maps back human feedback to the oracular reward, i.e., for sufficiently
informative feedback, we have
Ω(c, o, feedback) = R⋆ (c, o), ∀ c, o ∈ CHF , OHF .
Under that assumption, Ω can operate on DHF to create a dataset of context-output-reward tuples, Drew = {(c, o, r) :
c ∈ CHF , o ∈ OHF } where r = R⋆ (c, o). With Drew , learning the reward model Rϕ reduces to a regression problem
employing a function approximator. The regression problem is however underdetermined [Bishop 2006], and consequently multiple Rϕ functions can perfectly fit the training data Drew . However, almost all of these functions fail to
accurately represent the oracular reward (Figure 3). Due to the cost of human annotation, practically human feedback
can be collected on a very small subset of context and output pairs, i.e., CHF , OHF ⊂ C, O. The size of the reward and
feedback datasets relative to the hypothetical dataset of all possible inputs and outputs D can be measured by:
HF |
1. Context coverage: κ := |C|C|
HF |
′
2. Output coverage: ρ := |O
|O ′ | , where O = {o : (c, o) ∈ D, ∀c ∈ CHF }

Well-understood results in supervised learning suggest that the ratios ρ and κ along with the generalization capabilities
of the function approximator [Nakkiran et al. 2019; Schaeffer et al. 2023; Bailly et al. 2022] determine the generalization
performance of the reward model for (c, o) ∈ C, O. In practice, the values of ρ and κ are extremely small and consquently
the reward model often incorrectly generalizes on unseen (out-of-distribution) context-output pairs, assigning incorrect
rewards to such inputs. In the following sections, we study practical limitations of estimating reward models.
5.1

Limitations of the Reward Model

The reward model parameterized Rϕ : C × O → R is trained on Drew using a sufficiently representative function
approximator, to perfectly fit the training data, that is Rϕ (c, o) = R⋆ (c, o), ∀ o, c ∈ Drew . The limitations of the
resultant reward model may be studied under the following categories:
Misgeneralization: Human feedback is obtained on a very small subset of all possible context-output pairs. This
partial coverage over contexts and outputs in Drew combined with the use of function approximators for learning the
reward model results in the reward model Rϕ (c, o) incorrectly generalizing to data points that are out-of-distribution
relative to Drew. We have assumed a sufficiently
representative function approximator that perfectly fits the training

data, Ec,o∼Drew (R⋆ (c, o) − Rϕ (c, o))2 = 0. However, it cannot be ensured that Ec,o∈D
/ rew (R (c, o) − Rϕ (c, o))
will be zero. It would require a function approximator to perfectly generalize outside the training data distribution,
which is not generally attainable, especially when the ratios ρ, κ are minuscule.
The benefits of reinforcement learning algorithms over other methods for finetuning are contingent on access to an
accurate reward function (Section 6.3), necessitating accurate out-of-distribution generalization of the reward model.
The inaccurate extrapolation out-of-distribution results in an ‘imperfect’ reward model that provides feedback on
context-output pairs in a manner that when optimized, arbitrarily misaligns with human feedback (and resultant
preferences) for those context-output pairs. The output distribution of πrlhf trained on this inaccurate feedback and
can only be as good (or bad) as the reward signal provided by the reward model. This inaccurate generalization in
the reward model is one of the primary causes of phenomena like ‘reward hacking’ and ‘hallucinations’ [Kalai and
Vempala 2023], observed in practice.
Delayed feedback and Reward Sparsity: Reinforcement learning algorithms benefit from dense rewards as they
serve to quickly guide the agent to rewarding states, providing informative feedback to intermediate actions along the

The subsets are significantly smaller than C and O. Additionally, the feedback can be of any form: ratings, pair-wise feedback,
or language feedback (Section 7.3).

feedback is overloaded to capture additional mechanism-specific meta-data. For instance, for pair-wise preference, feedback
can store the preference relation and the (c, o) pair compared against.

Figure 3: The reward model tends to misgeneralize for inputs not found in its training data, i.e., for (c, o) ∈

This occurs in two ways: 1) when the context is not sampled by the prompting distribution for generating output and
receiving feedback on (represented by κ), and 2) when the support of the output generating distribution—the language
model—for a context does not span all possible outputs (represented by ρ). The latter is depicted in this figure.
trajectory. In RLHF, the feedback from human annotators is obtained for complete output generations. Consequently,
the reward model is trained to provide reward feedback only at the end of the generated output for a given context.
This delayed feedback increases the difficulty of optimization with RL algorithms, increasing their sample complexity.
Sparse feedback is a constraint inherent to dealing with text and language [Sokolov et al. 2016], as it is often unlikely
for a human to provide feedback on incomplete sentences. Methods in RL developed to deal with sparse feedback, for
instance by stitching together information from partial trajectories [Andrychowicz et al. 2017], cannot be applied directly
to textual output due to the semantic constraints of dealing with partial sentences. Denser rewards and corresponding
feedback result in faster training, improved sample efficiency [Wu et al. 2023d], and potentially better generalization.
Insights from linguistics may be employed to obtain feedback on partial output generations and in turn denser rewards.
Marginalization over preferences: The reward model averages over the preferences of all human annotators (and
other sources of feedback) to output a deterministic scalar reward for a given context-output pair. The expectation is
that averaging over the preferences of multiple sources would be representative of the preferences of an average human
persona [Deshpande et al. 2023b]. The results in rewards that are inconsistent with any single human’s preferences.
Such preferences are more appropriately denoted by an distribution of rewards for a context-output pair. A deterministic
model, in addition to discounting the uncertainty and variability of human preferences, cannot model such a distribution,
highlighting a case of model misspecification.
The reward model forms the core component of RLHF and dictates the performance of a language model. The
aforementioned shortcomings of the reward model highlight the need for safety measures that must be employed while
using a language model fine-tuned using RLHF.

Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Rewards

Reinforcement learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into value-based methods and policy-gradient methods
[Sutton and Barto 2018]. Value-based methods aim to learn the value of states (or state-action pairs) as measured by the
expected cumulative future reward from that state under a policy. These values serve as guides for picking the most
rewarding actions from each state, and the policy can be inferred from the value functions. Policy-gradient methods
directly train a parameterized policy using reward feedback to perform gradient ascent over the policy parameters and
maximize the expected cumulative reward. A benefit of policy gradient methods for language tasks is that they naturally
permit the optimization of stochastic policies, making them amendable for optimizing language models with stochastic
decoding algorithms. Below we provide a brief overview of policy gradient algorithms and refer interested readers to
Sutton et al. [1999]; Williams [1992]; Weng [2018] for a more rigorous treatment of the topic.
6.1

Policy Gradient Algorithms

Policy gradient algorithms update the parameters of an agent’s policy using reward feedback. Being gradient-based
algorithms, their update rule is of the form:
θ ←− θ + α∇θ J(πθ )
11

(15)

where J(πθ ) is the performance (Equation (12)) of the policy parameterized by θ. The gradient of the performance of a
policy ∇θ J(πθ ) can be estimated from samples in numerous ways, each affording varying degrees of variance and
estimation error. In sparse rewards settings, the gradient estimation variance is a common issue that baselines [Mei
et al. 2022] help address. A class of methods called actor-critic methods update the policy by leveraging estimated
value functions, called critics, to reduce gradient estimation variance. The algorithm used for training most current
state-of-the-art large language models, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al. 2017] is an actor-critic
algorithm with improvements over vanilla actor-critic to ensure stability during training. The improvements restrict
parameter updates at each iteration to prevent the policy distribution from drastically changing. The training loss
objective for PPO (PPO-Clip) takes the form:


Â(st , at ), clip
, 1 − ϵ, 1 + ϵ Â(st , at )
(16)
πθold (at | st )
πθold (at | st )
where Â(st , at ) is the estimate of the advantage function A(st , at ) := Q(st , at ) − V (st ) that captures the advantage
obtained in terms of cumulative reward by taking an action at from state st and then following the current policy,
relative to following the policy starting from state st . While this background suffices for the discussion in this paper, we
urge the reader to refer to Weng [2018] for a more in-depth explanation of the topic.
6.2

Misalignment due to Imperfect Rewards

In practice, a KL penalty DKL (πθ ||πpre ) with some weight β is added to the PPO training objective. This can be
interpreted either as a regularizer or a prior which helps prevent overoptimization of an imperfect reward model. Using
a reward model Rϕ , the policy at convergence learnt by training with the updated PPO objective can expressed directly
as a function of the reward [Scheurer et al. 2023; Rafailov et al. 2023] as,



πrlhf (o | c) ∝ πpre (o | c) exp
Rϕ (c, o)
(17)
β
where β is the weight on the KL penalty. Let Crew ⊂ C be the set of contexts in Drew .4 After training, πrlhf must generate
desirable (most rewarding) outputs when prompted with c ∈ Crew . But for out-of-distribution contexts, where the reward
estimation may be erroneous, the output distribution of πrlhf may be arbitrarily misaligned with human preferences and
generate undesirable output. This misalignment can be quantified by comparing against the policy trained with the
oracular reward. The set of contexts on which the performance of πrlhf is evaluated is denoted by Ceval with dCeval being
the distribution over those contexts. Let C ′ = Ceval /Crew be the set of contexts in the evaluation set that are not present
in Crew . The performance of πrlhf is given by:

For out-of-distribution contexts and outputs, the reward model is known to misgeneralize. The performance gap
increases with increasing discrepancy from the oracular reward, and the discrepancy is further weighted by the
likelihood of that (c, o) pair and its oracular reward value. Some observations from the above analysis:
• πrlhf assigns high probability to highly rewarding outputs (Equation (17)), which is beneficial in-distribution
contexts but can be harmful for out-of-distribution contexts when the reward model is erroneous.
• The deviation of the estimated reward from the oracular reward on unseen contexts exacerbates misalignment,
which can be mitigated by increasing the weight on the KL penalty due to the 1/β dependence in the exponent.
∗
• However, there is a trade-off. Increasing the value of β results in πrlhf
and πrlhf being closer to πpre and have a
lowered performance—due to increased weight in the KL penalty.
6.3

Why use Reinforcement Learning Algorithms?

The efficacy of RLHF heavily relies on the quality of the reward model, and thus a large fraction of future research
must focus on improving the reward model. Before allocating resources to that effort, it is essential to evaluate the
merits and downsides of employing reinforcement learning as the fine-tuning paradigm. In comparison to supervised
learning as an alternative approach, examining the gradient updates of a (vanilla) policy gradient algorithm alongside
those of a supervised learning algorithm (such as supervised fine-tuning) offers some insights.
Comparing Update Rules of Supervised Fine-Tuning and RLHF: In supervised fine-tuning (SFT), supervision is
provided with positive samples, and the language model is updated to increase the likelihood of those samples under the
model. Notably, there is no supervision provided for neutral or undesirable outputs, although it is a feasible option.
Given the optimal policy π ∗ (which may be a human expert), the objective of SFT is,


max Ec∼dC ,ow ∼π∗ (·|c) ln πθ (ow |c)
θ

and thus the gradients used to update the parameters of the language model are of the form:


∇θ := Ec∼dC ,ow ∼π∗ (·|c) ∇θ ln πθ (ow |c) .
This is analogous to behavior cloning in RL [Pomerleau 1988] which is known to struggle when faced with out-ofdistribution inputs.
The primary benefit that reinforcement learning algorithms provide is that they allow the language model to explore the
output space. Through its decoding algorithm, the language model exercises control over the distribution of outputs on
which feedback is acquired. This facilitates learning from both positive as well as negative feedback, i.e.,


max Ec∼dC ,o∼πθ (·|c) R⋆ (c, o)
θ

and the (vanilla) policy gradient update is:


∇θ := Ec∼dC ,o∼πθ (·|c) R⋆ (c, o)∇θ ln πθ (o|c) .
As highlighted in color, in SFT, the gradient is estimated only from the positive samples, while in RL, it is computed for
all samples (positive, negative, or neutral) weighted by their corresponding rewards. The gradient updates in RL are
more informative, leading to better generalization for the language model and improved sample efficiency. Beyond
exploration and richer gradients, the field of inverse reinforcement learning provides a natural formulation for training a
language model with human feedback [Arora and Doshi 2021].
In the following sections, we present a review of works that lead up to and are being rapidly added to this active area of
research. This review provides context for the first half of this work and also serves as a comprehensive introduction for
readers interested in getting started and understanding the topic of RLHF for language models.

Review of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Language Models

7.1

Language Model Pre-Training: Foundation for Large Language Models

Language Models (LMs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their impressive abilities to model
language and retain textual knowledge. The Transformer architecture, characterized by its use of self-attention
mechanisms, has become the standard for LMs [Vaswani et al. 2017]. It is employed in a range of models, including
BERT, T5, LLaMA, GPT-3, PALM, GLaM [Devlin et al. 2019; Raffel et al. 2019; Touvron et al. 2023a; Brown et al.
2020; Chowdhery et al. 2022; Du et al. 2021].
Pre-training has played an important role in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly
contributing to their remarkable performance across a myriad of downstream tasks [Brown et al. 2020; Chowdhery
et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022]. This process involves training models with an unsupervised training objective on
extensive datasets, often comprised of a diverse mix of web content, literary works, scientific documents, and code
repositories [Rae et al. 2021; Xie et al. 2023]. The scale of these datasets is critical, with studies highlighting the
superior performance of smaller models trained on larger datasets [Kaplan et al. 2020; Hoffmann et al. 2022; Touvron
et al. 2023a]. In addition to scale, the quality of training data, ensured through deduplication and filtering of low-quality
content, is a key determinant of model performance [Rae et al. 2021; Du et al. 2021; Hernandez et al. 2022; Lee
et al. 2021]. Masked Language Modeling (MLM) [Devlin et al. 2019] and Causal Language Modeling [Radford and
Narasimhan 2018] are the most common objectives used for pretraining, with latter showing notable success in recent
Large Language Model series such as GPT, PaLM, OPT [Anil et al. 2023; OpenAI 2023; Zhang et al. 2022].
Studies demonstrate that pre-training by itself is responsible for the bulk of the observed capabilities even in downstream
tasks [Brown et al. 2020; Raffel et al. 2019]. The simple pre-training objective of next, or masked, token prediction
imbibes the LMs with a range of capabilities. They are few-task learners, without the need for fine-tuning. This applies
to a variety of tasks from text generation, reasoning, question answering, summarization, and translation to name a few.
However, though scaling pretrained language models (PLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across a variety of tasks,
they suffer from several limitations, such as the inability to follow human instructions [Ouyang et al. 2022]. This is
because PLMs suffer from objective mismatch problems (See Section 2), as they are trained on generic internet data. As
a result, PLMs need to learn to mimic the conflicting behavior of billions of humans. Further, the Maximum Likelihood
Estimate on the next token prediction for such data doesn’t explicitly penalize the model for hallucinating concepts,
i.e., generating concepts not encapsulated within its internal representation, and even important & unimportant errors
are given equal weightage. Moreover, pretrained models often show unintended behavior such as generating harmful,
biased, untruthful, and low-quality content [Perez et al. 2022].
Supervised-Finetuning To address the shortcomings faced by PLMs, a straightforward approach is to fine-tune them
on a set of high-quality downstream datasets that are indicative of the intended task and behavior. For example, for
instruction-following, human annotations can be collected on a set of input prompts, or input instances of existing
public datasets can be re-formatted for instruction-following format. The model is then simply fine-tuned on these
human demonstrations, often with the same pretraining objective. This increases the likelihood of generating desirable
text and makes the model less biased and harmful. Nonetheless, in order to generate high-quality text, it is crucial to
note that the task of distinguishing between high and low-quality text is inherently subjective and challenging, with end
users being humans. Thus, quality assessment rests on human judgment and varies significantly based on the individual
evaluator’s perspective [Yi et al. 2019; Fan et al. 2022; Ziegler et al. 2019]. Incorporating human feedback into such a
process can be challenging, and collecting high-quality human demonstrations can be expensive and not scalable.
7.2

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Overview and Motivation

The Importance of Human Feedback in Language Models The alignment of a model with the user’s intentions and
preferences is critical, and incorporating human feedback in model training is a key step towards achieving this (Section
2). However, the process of obtaining high-quality human feedback, particularly in the form of human demonstrations,
can be a resource-intensive process, both in terms of time and cost. A more efficient approach is to collect feedback on
the outputs generated by the model and train the language model to incorporate this feedback. However, collecting such
a large amount of feedback is also costly and impractical for real-time/online collection during training.
The Role of RLHF in Language Models Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) offers a solution to
these challenges. In RLHF, human feedback is collected offline and used to train a reward model. This reward model then
acts as a surrogate for human feedback during training, providing reward signals to the Language Model. Reinforcement
learning algorithms form the natural candidates for training a model from scalar evaluative feedback, as provided by the
reward model. This forms the essence of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [Christiano et al.

2017] as used to train Language Models. This approach is more sample-efficient and has shown more promising results
compared to supervised fine-tuning alone [Ouyang et al. 2022].
Applications of RLHF in Language Models In early works, RL has been used in training Language models
across various domains such as dialogue generation [Yi et al. 2019; Li et al. 2016; Jaques et al. 2019], machine
translation [Kreutzer et al. 2018a; Nguyen et al. 2017; Fernandes et al. 2022; Sokolov et al. 2016], text generation [Li
et al. 2017; Shi et al. 2018; Zhou and Xu 2020; Ziebart et al. 2008], semantic parsing [Lawrence and Riezler 2018],
summarization [Stiennon et al. 2020; Ziegler et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2021]. More commonly, these methods were trained
using non-differentiable automated evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE [Ranzato et al. 2015; Shen et al. 2015;
Keneshloo et al. 2018], or simulated feedback [Nguyen et al. 2017]. However, while the combination of RL and human
feedback has been extensively studied [Knox and Stone 2008; Christiano et al. 2017], it is only recently that RLHF with
LLMs has achieved significant success in sequence-to-sequence tasks such as Summarization [Stiennon et al. 2020;
Ziegler et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2021], providing reliable answers with citations to queries [Nakano et al. 2021; Glaese
et al. 2022], creating Helpful, Harmless and Honest dialogue agents aligned with broad human values [Ouyang et al.
2022; Bai et al. 2022a].
Formulating Language Modeling as a RL Problem Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning paradigm for
a setting where an agent must make a sequence of decisions while interacting with an environment and obtaining
evaluative feedback in the form of rewards. The agent’s objective is to maximize the total reward it receives over time.
In the context of language models, the agent is the language model itself, and its actions consist of generating tokens
from its vocabulary. The agent’s policy, which maps states to actions, is represented by the language model’s parameters.
The agent receives rewards from the environment, which in this case is a reward function that forms a surrogate from
human feedback (Section 4). The agent’s objective is to optimize its actions (by updating its policy) to maximize
the cumulative reward. A thorough mathematical formulation can be found Section 3, and has been summarized in
Table 2 and Figure 2. While these details are sufficient for further discussion in the paper, we refer interested readers to
Arulkumaran et al. [2017]; Sutton and Barto [2018] for more details about reinforcement learning.
The Workflow of RLHF RLHF, as first popularized by [Christiano et al. 2017] for mastering Atari Games consists
of three crucial stages. An overview of standard RLHF workflow is highlighted in Figure 5. The first stage involves the

is followed by all RLHF workflows for training language models. This is followed by an iterative loop starting with
collecting human feedback on model-generated outputs, training a reward model, and updating the language model
using a suitable RL algorithm.

collection of human feedback on a set of <input, output> pairs. These pairs can be sourced from existing datasets
or generated by the pre-trained model for a given set of input prompts. The second stage involves learning a reward
model from the collected human feedback. The reward model is trained to output a scalar reward for a given <input,
output> pair, indicating the favorability of the pair. In essence, the reward model is trained to mimic human feedback,
such that for a given input, desirable outputs are scored higher than undesirable outputs. The final stage involves the
RLHF training of the language model, where the reward model provides reward signals on model outputs, usually in the
form of scalar reward. The parameters of the language model are then updated based on these reward signals using an
appropriate policy-gradient RL algorithm, updating the model to produce more rewarding outputs.
These stages can be performed iteratively, with the intermediately trained model generating more prompts to collect
additional human feedback. This feedback is then used to train the reward model, and the process is repeated multiple
16

times [Stiennon et al. 2020; Bai et al. 2022a; Menick et al. 2022]. In the following sections, we discuss each of
these stages in detail. We start with Human Feedback Collection (Section 7.3), followed by training the Initial Policy
(Section 7.4), Reward Model Training (Section 7.5), and finally RLHF Training (Section 7.6). Finally, we discuss the
properties of RLHF-trained models and their limitations in Section 7.7.
7.3

Human Feedback

In this section, we discuss the nature, objectives, and different types of human feedback, followed by the challenges and
strategies associated with collecting high-quality feedback.
7.3.1

Nature and Objectives of Human Feedback

Tasks such as summarization and providing helpful answers are inherently ambiguous and require human judgment to
evaluate the quality of the generated text. Automated metrics like BLEU and ROUGE [Lin and Och 2004] often do
not correlate with human judgment [Liu et al. 2016; Schluter 2017; Sellam et al. 2020; Stiennon et al. 2020], making
them unreliable for evaluation and training. Thus, acquiring high-quality human feedback to align the model with
human behavior becomes crucial. Feedback is typically provided on the outputs generated by the model (or input-output
pairs from the dataset), and subsequently, the model is trained to learn from this feedback. However, capturing diverse
human preferences is a challenging task. One approach to encapsulate subjective human preferences is to approximate
them using “models of human behavior”. This concept of human behavior models has roots in diverse fields such
as econometrics [McFadden 1981], psychology [O’Connor 1989], and inverse reinforcement learning. A notable
example is the Bradley-Terry model [Bradley and Terry 1952], a probabilistic model that encodes the preference of one
output over another in pairwise competitions. In the context of RLHF, reward models that form surrogates for human
preferences serve as such models of human behavior.
The type of feedback collected depends on the intended objective to be displayed by the fine-tuned language model.
Askell et al. [2021] proposes three objectives for an aligned Language Model: Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness
(HHH). These objectives can be broadly defined as follows:
- Helpful: A Language Model is considered helpful if it can efficiently complete tasks or answer questions (while
being harmless), ask relevant follow-up questions when necessary, and appropriately redirect ill-informed requests.
Helpfulness includes context-dependent aspects such as informativeness, coherence, relevance, creativity, and specificity.
- Honest: Honesty in a Language Model implies providing accurate information, expressing appropriate levels of
uncertainty, and honestly conveying its capabilities, knowledge, and internal state. Language Models are particularly
susceptible to hallucination [Khandelwal et al. 2019; Maynez et al. 2020], making it essential to penalize such behavior.
Unlike helpfulness, honesty is more objectively evaluated.
- Harmless: A harmless Language Model should avoid offensive or biased behavior, refuse to aid in dangerous acts,
recognize disguised nefarious attempts, and act with modesty and care when providing advice with potentially sensitive
or consequential impacts.
These broad objectives, as mentioned above, encompass specific objectives, which can be considered subcategories.
For example, in the case of summarization, the summary should be helpful to the reader and should not contain any
false or harmful information. Similarly, the goal of reducing bias in a dialogue agent’s responses can be considered a
subset of the Harmless objective. At the same time, coherence and creativity in the generated text are aspects of being
helpful. These objectives are not mutually exclusive and are context and task-dependent. Even human labelers and
researchers have shown disagreements in annotation [Kreutzer et al. 2018b].
7.3.2

Types of Human Feedback

Human Feedback is usually collected on model-generated outputs. Good feedback should incorporate information on
where the model output is lacking and how to improve it. A simple process is to let human labelers provide feedback on
a set of model outputs generated from a dataset of prompts or inputs. Alternatively, existing datasets can be repurposed
to incorporate implicit feedback, such as rating different user choices [Kreutzer et al. 2018a]. Regardless of the process,
human feedback can be collected in various forms, such as binary responses, preference ranking, language feedback,
etc. While the choice of feedback type depends on the downstream task, it is essential to note that the feedback should
be collected in a way that is easy for humans (labelers) to provide; there is high agreement among the labelers, and it
is also informative. In this section, we classify the feedback into four different categories: rating feedback, ranking
feedback, language feedback, and miscellaneous feedback.
17

Rating Feedback The simplest form of rating feedback is binary feedback, where the labeler is asked to provide a
binary response (yes/no) to a given input [Li et al. 2016; Scheurer et al. 2023]. Binary feedback is easy to collect and
interpret. Some works have used binary responses to get feedback on multiple questions (such as if the generated text is
coherent) [Yi et al. 2019]. A richer form of feedback is to ask labelers to provide a rating on a scale. The scale can be
continuous [Graham et al. 2013], or be similar to Likert Scale [Likert 1932] (where user rate using an integer from 1 to
k) [Kreutzer et al. 2018a; Jaques et al. 2019]. A different variant of rating feedback is to provide categorical feedback
such as ‘incorrect’, ‘partially-correct’, and ‘correct’ [Gao et al. 2023]. While rating feedback is easy to specify, often
inter-annotator agreement is low because of the subjective nature of the task [Kreutzer et al. 2018b]. Further, the order
of examples presented to the annotator may bias the results [Yannakakis and Hallam 2011]. Moreover, it is challenging
to differentiate between data points with outputs of similar quality since feedback is provided individually to each
output without comparison.
Ranking or Preference Feedback Ranking feedback or Preference-based feedback has been extensively used in
the recent development of AI assistants and found to be both convenient to collect and performative. Specifically, the
labeler is offered with binary [Stiennon et al. 2020] or multiple choice options [Ziegler et al. 2019], and asked to select
the most appropriate response based on a certain set of instructions (directions). Recently, [Zhu et al. 2023a] has shown
convergence guarantees for reward models trained using this feedback form. Moreover, given an input prompt, it is
common to ask labelers to rank k (> 2) generated responses, which are then repurposed as pairwise comparisons for
the reward model [Ouyang et al. 2022]. However, collecting pairwise feedback might still be difficult for near similar
responses and may result in much time spent by the labelers even on single input [Scheurer et al. 2023]. Additionally,
preference-based feedback provides a very sparse signal, conveying limited information about the reasoning behind the
provided feedback. Moreover, it is provided only on the complete text generated by the model (trajectory) and not on
specific parts of the text (particular state) [Pang et al. 2022; Lewis et al. 2017]. Moreover, preference-based feedback
provides no further improvement in terms of inter-annotator agreement when compared to rating feedback [Kreutzer
et al. 2018b].
Language Feedback A more informative way to provide feedback is in free-form language. This provides a dense
reward signal, specifying more precisely where the model goes wrong or needs improvement. For example, consider
the case where the output generated by the model is “A humorous story about a specific profession involving person A
and person B.“ The previous feedback forms would provide only sparse signals, such as indicating that the output is
inappropriate. However, this feedback alone will not help the model identify the cause of inappropriateness, and the
single example alone can imply that the text is inappropriate because: “it is wrong to create humor in general,“ “it is
wrong to create humor about specific professions“ or “it is wrong to involve individuals in humorous stories“ and so
on. On the other hand, free-form feedback can provide more precise feedback, such as “It is inappropriate to create
humor that targets specific professions.“ This enables the model to understand the issue from a single example better
and generalize to similar cases without learning from more examples.
Language Feedback has been extensively used in various domains such as Dialogue models [Li et al. 2016; Hancock
et al. 2019], Summarization [Scheurer et al. 2023], Question-Answering [Li et al. 2022], Code generation [Chen 2023].
Recently, [Scheurer et al. 2023] has shown that language feedback is more effective than preference-based feedback in
the context of summarization systems. Also, as [Hancock et al. 2019] discusses, getting preference-based feedback
is plausible for paid labelers but not for real users using real deployed systems. Real users interact with the system
through free-form language; hence, getting human feedback in the free-form language is more natural. Although taskdependent, [Scheurer et al. 2023] further find that labelers take only 3x times to provide language feedback compared to
preference-based feedback, despite providing much granular information. However, incorporating language feedback in
the RLHF pipeline is not straightforward, and there has been limited work in this direction.
Miscellaneous Feedback Apart from providing single feedback, methods have experimented with using a combination
of feedback types or altogether different types. For example, [Glaese et al. 2022] uses a combination of rule violation
feedback (binary), preference-based feedback, and rating of evidence. [Uesato et al. 2022; Korbak et al. 2023] provide
segment-level feedback instead of the whole text, and [Wu et al. 2023c] provide feedback at the token level. Moreover,
some studies employ indirect methods for collecting feedback. For example, [Kreutzer et al. 2018a] uses human
interactions on translated eBay titles to find more preferred translations.
Further, it is also possible to provide computational feedback, for example, from automated metrics [Bahdanau et al.
2016], forms of synthetic feedback [Kim et al. 2023; Black et al. 2023], web descriptions [Hanjie et al. 2022; Aggarwal
et al. 2023], LLM generated feeedback [Shinn et al. 2023; Madaan et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2022a], which might, in
turn, be generated based on certain human requisites or instructions [Bai et al. 2022b; Sun et al. 2023; Kundu et al.
2023]. However, these methods still use little to no human feedback and may have several unexplored limitations such
as instability and lack of robustness [Shumailov et al. 2023; Alemohammad et al. 2023; Gudibande et al. 2023] and are
18

not the focus of this survey. We refer readers to Fernandes et al. [2023] for discussion on different type of feedback
used in Natural Language Generation.
7.3.3

Collection of High-Quality Human Feedback

Collecting high-quality human feedback is a challenging task that has been the focus of extensive research. The quality
of feedback is pivotal; subpar or noisy feedback can significantly hamper the performance of the final trained model. For
example, for summarization tasks, [Ziegler et al. 2019] discovered that their model predominantly extracted verbatim
lines from the document. This was later attributed to low-quality feedback by [Stiennon et al. 2020]. Similarly, the
size of the feedback is also crucial. For example, despite employing similar methodologies, [Lightman et al. 2023]
identified a need for a ‘greater amount of feedback’ for the methods in [Uesato et al. 2022] to be effective, as the
intended objective was not even observed in the latter work.
The provision of clear and unambiguous instructions to the labelers is a fundamental requirement [Ziegler et al. 2019;
Nakano et al. 2021]. Failure to do so can not only result in low-quality feedback but also introduce systematic bias
in the collected feedback and, consequently, the model [Parmar et al. 2022]. Typically, labelers are provided with a
comprehensive set of instructions, including guidelines for handling edge cases [Bai et al. 2022a]. [Glaese et al. 2022]
even provides a tutorial to the selected few labelers.
Researchers typically screen labelers to ensure they possess the necessary skills to provide feedback. For instance, in
the case of translation tasks, bilingual labelers with native proficiency in both languages are preferred [Kreutzer et al.
2018b]. Additionally, a minimum educational qualification is generally preferred. For example, [Stiennon et al. 2020]
requires labelers to have at least a high-school degree, whereas [Nakano et al. 2021], [Glaese et al. 2022] and [Bai et al.
2022a] require a minimum undergraduate and master’s degree respectively. The end goal also influences the selection
of labelers. For instance, creating a harmless and helpful chatbot necessitates a diverse group of labelers with varying
backgrounds and demographics [Ouyang et al. 2022; Bai et al. 2022a] as otherwise this may result in implicit biases in
the model [Peng et al. 2022]. For instance, currently deployed language models have been shown to reflect views more
aligned with western audiences [Durmus et al. 2023] and may have systematic political biases [Santurkar et al. 2023],
partly owing to the lack of annotators from diverse demographic groups.
However, despite screening, there may be low agreement among the annotators themselves, or even between researchers
and annotators [Kreutzer et al. 2018a]. The labelers are further screened based on two standard criteria 1.) inter-annotator
agreement, i.e., the agreement between different annotators on the same example, and 2.) expert-annotator agreement,
i.e., the agreement between annotators and experts [Kreutzer et al. 2018b]. Specifically, the former metric ensures that
the labelers are consistent in their feedback, and the latter metric is used to keep only those labelers that have a high
agreement with experts. [Menick et al. 2022] creates a group of super-raters who have a high agreement with experts,
and the group is expanded upon iteratively. Even after filtering, some methods ensure a hands-on relationship with
labellers [Stiennon et al. 2020] and have also created Slack groups for discussing any bugs, issues, or edge cases [Bai
et al. 2022a].
7.4

Supervised Fine-Tuning: Limitations and Role

Upon the collection of high-quality feedback, the subsequent step is to assimilate this feedback to train the model. The
most direct method to achieve this is to perform supervised fine-tuning of the language model based on the collected
feedback. Specifically, human feedback is gathered in the form of expert outputs on input prompts, also referred to as
human demonstrations. These human demonstrations can be perceived as positive example outputs to prompts that
should be generated by the language model. The model is then fine-tuned on these demonstrations using the same
pretraining objective, and this process in RL terminology is often termed behavior cloning [Nakano et al. 2021].
Additionally, when dealing with preference data, the model can be directly fine-tuned on preferred feedback. However,
this approach exhibits limitations by not accounting for negative feedback—outputs that the model should avoid
generating. This is crucial for training robust models that can handle adversarial situations and identify and rectify
errors. To tackle this limitation, alternative methods that incorporate both positive and negative feedback have been
developed, as discussed in Section 7.9.
In addition to human demonstrations, existing public instances from NLP datasets can be used as instruction tuning
demonstrations [Wei et al. 2021]. This usually involves creating new instruction-tuning datasets by adding task
instructions to existing examples from the dataset [Ajith et al. 2023]. In another field of work, prompts from the initial
iterations of GPT-3 [Brown et al. 2020] served to real customers through Web API were used to fine-tune the model on
expert (human) demonstrations provided by contracted labelers [Ouyang et al. 2022].
19

Limitations of Supervised Finetuning While finetuning on supervised data enhances the model beyond its pretrained
version in following instructions and intended tasks, it suffers from numerous limitations. For instance, it does not
penalize the model for hallucinating or permit it to learn from neutral or negative feedback. This can lead to harmful
and unintended behavior, making it easier to prompt such models to elicit them [Ganguli et al. 2022; Perez et al. 2022].
Furthermore, behavior cloning is likely to perform poorly in out-of-distribution prompts [Pomerleau 1988]. These
limitations may stem from the fact that during behavior cloning, the model is not allowed to explore the vast space of
possible actions, i.e., the model is not allowed to generate outputs that are not present in the demonstrations and, in turn,
get feedback for them. We refer readers to Section 6.3 for theoretical discussion on the limitations of SFT.
SFT as Initial Policy in RLHF models Despite its caveats, supervised fine-tuning plays a pivotal role in RLHF as it
provides a robust initial policy, which allows RLHF methods to work well. From an RL perspective, learning algorithms
such as the widely used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in training sequence-to-sequence models, struggle to
improve from poor initializations, especially when the action space is large, as in the case of text generation. This is
because these methods use model-based exploration, which is ineffective when the transition probabilities over many
actions are similar [Nguyen et al. 2017] i.e., different text outputs have similar probabilities of generation.
Furthermore, as we discuss in Section 7.6, usually a KL penalty is applied to ensure the output text generated by our
RL-tuned model is close to the initial model. Thus, during RL training, it is preferable to start with an initial model that
already generates decent-quality text.
Empirical studies have demonstrated that starting with fine-tuning on high-quality human demonstrations results in
significant improvements over starting with pretrained language models [Stiennon et al. 2020; Ouyang et al. 2022]. For
instance, InstructGPT collects API customer and labeler written prompts and outputs to fine-tune their model before
initiating with the RLHF training [Ouyang et al. 2022].
[Glaese et al. 2022] has also shown that starting with a prompted model (dialogue) instead of fine-tuning on label
demonstrations is possible. However, they start with a large model (70B parameters) and do not perform a comparative
study starting with fine-tuning on human demonstrations. Thus, it cannot be definitively concluded that starting with a
prompted model is equivalent to fine-tuning on human demonstrations. Moreover, prompting has the limitation of using
up a major portion of the context length of the model, which, apart from the computational burden, can also be crucial
for some tasks because of limited context length. [Askell et al. 2021] propose using context distillation by training the
model to generate output similar to its prompted counterpart using KL divergence loss. They find similar performance
to the prompted model, and the method has been used in their subsequent works [Bai et al. 2022a].
In conclusion, while supervised fine-tuning can be utilized independently of the RLHF pipeline, it still suffers from
several significant limitations. However, it still serves as an integral step in the RLHF pipeline, providing a robust initial
policy crucial for subsequent RL training.
7.5

Reward Modeling

Reward as a Proxy for Human Feedback After the collection of human feedback, the next challenge is training
the language model effectively. Although supervised fine-tuning offers a straightforward method, its effectiveness is
limited by the volume of human feedback. In contrast, RLHF introduces a reward model to emulate human feedback,
thereby acting as a stand-in for the true reward function, i.e., the actual human feedback. This reward model, usually
much smaller than the language model, facilitates fine-tuning the language model using feedback generated by it on
new model outputs, avoiding the need for additional costly human annotation. In practice, using a reward model over
supervised fine-tuning has been found more data-efficient [Ramamurthy et al. 2022].
Training a Reward Model The reward model is a fine-tuned language model that assigns a scalar reward score
to an input-output pair. The last embedding layer is replaced with a single projection layer that outputs this scalar
reward. While the reward model can learn from various types of feedback, recent studies highlight the simplicity and
effectiveness of preference-based feedback [Ouyang et al. 2022; Bai et al. 2022a]. This approach involves fine-tuning
the initialized reward model to predict the preference between two trajectories (output text) given the same input
prompt or context. The reward is typically modeled as a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [Bradley and Terry 1952],
where the probability of preferring one trajectory over another is a function of the difference in their reward scores.
Mathematically, this can be represented as:
Pr((o ≻ o′ , c) | ϕ) = σ[Rϕ (c, o) − Rϕ (c, o′ )]

(18)

where σ(x) = 1+e1−x is the sigmoid function, o and o’ represent the two trajectories, and their rewards are represented
as Rϕ (c, o) and Rϕ (c, o′ ) respectively. This form of reward modeling has been found to provide smoother rewards and
is less noisy [Christiano et al. 2017]. A similar method can then be used for ranking between k trajectories (k > 2),
20

where the reward is modeled as a Plackett-Luce (PL) model [Plackett 1975; Luce 1979]. Moreover, [Zhu et al. 2023a]
provides theoretical proof of convergence guarantees under the Maximum Likelihood estimate of both BTL and PL
models.
The size and initialization of the reward model are critical determinants of its performance. While smaller reward models
are easier to train, scaling laws suggest that larger models yield better agreement with actual human preferences [Askell
et al. 2021]. However, [Ouyang et al. 2022] found that training very large reward models can be unstable and result in
overfitting. Instead, they report good performance even when using a reward model that is 30 times smaller than the
policy model.
Regarding initialization, multiple methods have been proposed. While [Ziegler et al. 2019] fine-tunes a pretrained
language model on preference data collected on model-generated outputs, [Ouyang et al. 2022] trains a GPT-3 based
reward model on publicly available datasets. However, only a slight advantage was found over using pretrained language
models or supervised-fine-tuned models. Leveraging publicly available preference datasets (such as ranked answers
from StackOverflow), as suggested by [Askell et al. 2021], notably enhances reward model performance, especially for
smaller models and datasets.

Challenges in Reward Modeling The reward model is initially trained on a selected set of input prompts and
corresponding initial model outputs. As the model training progresses, it is crucial for the reward model to generalize
to new model outputs and potentially new input prompts. We refer readers to Section 5.1 for a deeper theoretical
exploration of this aspect.
Regarding the generalization capabilities of reward models, Ouyang et al. [2022] presents findings that demonstrate
high generalization to held-out test labelers. This capability is of paramount importance since a majority of the inputs
encountered during language model training would be out-of-distribution w.r.t. the reward model training phase.
Generalization capability depends on various factors such as the dataset’s size, the amount of noise in the feedback
dataset, and the characteristics of the pretrained reward model.
Moreover, the robustness and calibration of the reward models with respect to actual human preferences are essential
for their effectiveness. A well-calibrated reward model should accurately predict the probability of a human preferring
one output over another. Bai et al. [2022a] discovered that when training solely on a helpfulness feedback dataset, their
model exhibits strong calibration. However, when trained on a mixture of helpfulness and harmlessness datasets, the
model is underconfident in its predictions. To assess robustness, a common practice involves evaluating the policy
model trained using the reward model.
To assess robustness, a common practice involves evaluating the policy model trained using the reward model. Interestingly, Bai et al. [2022a] discerned that smaller reward models and higher rewards correlate with decreased robustness.
This phenomenon arises from the reward model’s initial training on model outputs with naturally low rewards. To
address this distribution shift, an approach involving iterated training of the reward model is proposed (see Section 7.6).
In summation, the discussion underscores that the trained reward model on preferences is an imperfect proxy of human
feedback, especially in out-of-domain cases.

Moving Beyond Scalar Rewards Apart from providing a single scalar reward at the end of a trajectory (complete
text output), several methods model a more fine-grained approach. [Uesato et al. 2022; Korbak et al. 2023] provides
a segment-level reward during training, a method also known as process supervision. Interestingly, while [Uesato
et al. 2022] did not find any major downstream performance improvement with their method, [Lightman et al. 2023]
used similar methodology but instead trained larger models on a larger feedback dataset coupled with evaluation on a
more difficult task found segment-level feedback to be significantly more useful. [Scheurer et al. 2023] uses language
feedback from another LLM that implicitly acts like a reward model for the training of the policy model.
While ideally, as discussed in Section 4, the reward model provides a dual-purpose reward taking into account both the
task information (eg, summarization task) and the task-specific evaluation ((a condescending summary is rewarded
less than a neutral summary). However, diversifying the approach, some strategies involve the use of multiple reward
models, each specializing in distinct characteristics or specific tasks. [Wu et al. 2023c; Ramé et al. 2023] demonstrate
the efficacy of training separate reward models for specific attributes such as coherency and factuality. Similarly, [Glaese
et al. 2022] introduces two reward models—one for preference and another for rule violation in dialogue generation.
They found using two models over one to be more effective, likely because of a smaller feedback dataset. Further,
since the preference-based reward model provides a delayed reward (reward is provided only at the end of the whole
trajectory), the A2C algorithm, when used for sequence modeling [Bahdanau et al. 2016] proposes potential-based
reward shaping, where intermediate generations (states) are also rewarded.
21

In conclusion, the reward modeling process is a critical component of RLHF which involves the training of a model
to emulate human feedback, thereby acting as a surrogate for the true reward function. The size, initialization, and
generalization capabilities of the reward model are all crucial factors that influence its performance. The reward model
must be robust, well-calibrated, and additionally can provide more fine-grained feedback to the policy model training.

RLHF Finetuning of Language Models

The trained reward model is utilized for finetuning the language model. Framing the task as reinforcement learning, with
the language model as the policy, algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C) [Schulman et al. 2017; Bahdanau et al. 2016] are used to update the parameters of the language model such
that the generated outputs maximize the obtained reward. These are gradient-based methods, called policy-gradient
algorithms, that directly update the parameters of the policy using the evaluative reward feedback The following sections
primarily focus on the widely used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Algorithm, while the same concepts are
applicable to other candidate algorithms [Ouyang et al. 2022].
7.6.1

Training Procedure

The pre-trained/SFT language model is prompted with contexts/prompts from a prompting dataset. The prompting
dataset may or may not be identical to the one used for collecting human demonstrations in the SFT phase [Ouyang
et al. 2022]. The model outputs, along with the inputs, are passed to the reward model that generates a scalar output
indicating the reward for this input-output pair. The reward is used as evaluative feedback to update the parameters
of the language model using suitable RL algorithms that result in increasing the likelihood of the generation of more
rewarding outputs. We next discuss a few commonly used RL algorithms for the process.
7.6.2

Training Algorithms

The commonly used policy-gradient algorithms for aligning LLMs using RLHF are PPO and A2C [Schulman et al.
2017; Bahdanau et al. 2016]. Both fall under the category of actor-critic algorithms. These algorithms consist of two
main components: the critic learns the expected cumulative reward for an input-output pair, called the value function,
and the actor is the LLM policy that gets updated based on the cumulative reward estimates obtained from the critic.
The reward values are obtained from the previously trained reward model, which is kept frozen during the RL training.
As the LLM encounters more interactions and collects more reward feedback, it uses the data to update the value
function and the LLM policy parameters. The training objective (Equation (15)) aims to update the parameters of the
policy to increase the expected cumulative reward of the LLM policy. A2C and A3C [Mnih et al. 2016] use an estimate
of the advantage of taking an action instead of the action-value function for that action as a way of incurring lesser
variance in policy gradient estimation. PPO additionally constrains the policy update at each iteration from straying too
far by using a clipped objective [Schulman et al. 2017]. This helps provide additional stability to the training. Training
LLMs at a large scale requires an immense engineering effort, and practical implementations of these algorithms require
domain-specific variations. While major progress has been made towards efficient training and inference of LLMs [Xia
et al.; Lagunas et al. 2021; Xia et al. 2022; Su et al. 2023; Murahari et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2022b; Hinton et al. 2015;
Yin et al. 2021; Murahari et al. 2022], there is still a lot of scope for improvement in the sample efficiency and stability
of training algorithms for RLHF. Recent work has addressed these challenges with different variants of these algorithms
tackling different aspects ranging from practical implementation issues such as high memory usage [Santacroce et al.
2023], changes specific for NLP [Ramamurthy et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2023b], training instability [Zheng et al. 2023]. We
refer readers to [Weng 2018] for a comprehensive survey of policy gradient algorithms.
7.6.3

Improving Training Stability

Imperfections in the reward model reduce the effectivity of the training algorithms, as the value functions learned,
and in turn thus the gradient updates, become inaccurate. Thus, using the aforementioned algorithms with the learned
reward model may lead the language model to exploit the imperfections and generate nonsensical text, often called
‘reward overoptimization’. This can be mitigated with appropriate regularization during training. As the pre-trained or
SFT model (policy) is already a highly capable LLM, Jaques et al. [2019] propose using a copy of the initial model
to regularize training. The aim is to ensure that even as the policy parameters are updated to maximize reward, the
outputs of the updated policy do not stray too far from the initial policy. In particular, an additional regularization
term of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the policy being trained and the initial policy is added to the
RL training objective in the form of a reward penalty, commonly called the KL penalty. Theoretically, the addition
of this KL penalty has been shown to be similar to performing Bayesian inference [Korbak et al. 2022] on the model.
A hyperparameter β controls the weight of this KL penalty regularization during training. Further, it is common to
22

compare different variants of RL algorithms at a fixed KL distance from the initial model, with the aim of maximizing
the reward with the lowest possible KL divergence.
7.6.4

Iterated RLHF

As training progresses, the reward model can become miscalibrated with human preferences at higher rewards [Bai
et al. 2022a]. This is because the reward model was trained on outputs from the initial model, which inherently have
low-valued rewards. Consequently, several methods [Stiennon et al. 2020; Bai et al. 2022a] have employed an iterative
training approach, where new outputs are generated by the updated policy, which are then annotated by humans for
feedback. The reward model is then retrained based on this new human feedback, followed by training of the policy
model. This process, referred to as Iterated-RLHF or Online-RLHF, is repeated for several iterations. Although effective,
this procedure is naturally expensive and time-consuming.
Limitations in Current RLHF practices Despite the impressive results achieved by RLHF in practice, it is an
unstable training process [Choshen et al. 2019]. Moreover, it is highly sensitive to hyperparameters, necessitating a
significant amount of hyperparameter tuning [Rafailov et al. 2023; Yuan et al. 2023]. Furthermore, the generalization
capabilities of RLHF and other issues, such as underperformance on metrics not captured by the reward model, warrant
further investigation. A comprehensive examination of these aspects is discussed in Section 7.7.
7.7

Limitations of RLHF Models

Fine-tuning models using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) showcase a remarkable ability to
align with human preferences and generalize to new scenarios and is more sample-efficient than supervised fine-tuning.
Nonetheless, these models exhibit characteristics and behaviors that warrant careful consideration, prompting the need
for further exploration and refinement.
Alignment Capabilities One intriguing property, referred to as the Alignment Tax, was identified by [Ouyang et al.
2022]. The phenomenon reveals that RLHF-trained chat models sometimes perform poorly compared to initial policy in
downstream tasks, suggesting a cost linked to aligning human preferences. To mitigate this, they propose incorporating
the pre-training objective into RLHF-finetuning, which substantially reduces the Alignment Tax. Moreover, [Bai et al.
2022a] indicates that larger models tend to exhibit lower alignment tax. [Bai et al. 2022a] also observed that RLHF
models better align with human preferences as the scales of both the reward model and policy model increase. It is
noteworthy, however, that a similar scaling effect could be seen in instruction-finetuned SFT models. A comprehensive
comparison of the scaling effects on RLHF versus SFT models is currently lacking in the literature and would make for
an intriguing future study.
Generalization Capabilities RLHF models have exhibited impressive generalization capabilities beyond their training
data, including generalization on new prompts and human feedback. For instance, [Ouyang et al. 2022] demonstrates
RLHF-tuned models answering coding questions and following instructions in multiple languages despite being
finetuned only in English and with limited code-related prompts. This suggests that the majority of a language model’s
capabilities are acquired during pre-training, and RLHF merely aligns these capabilities to elicit desired behavior.
However, this generalization can be a double-edged sword, potentially leading to undesirable outcomes, especially when
the feedback signal is sparse. For instance, the initial LLaMA2 Chat Model5 , when prompted "How to kill a process?"
refused to answer, drawing ethical concerns, though the intended answer was about terminating a computer process.
This behavior likely stems from the model’s extended generalization from examples that trained it to reject violent
queries. The example further highlights the problems of imperfect rewards leading to misgeneralization, as discussed in
Section 6.2. Further, a distributional shift between prompts used for reward model finetuning and RLHF training can
result in the policy model misaligning with human preferences [Bai et al. 2022a]. Further, during RL training, outputs
are sampled from the language model, which is evaluated using the reward model. However, deviations in parameters
used for sampling outputs from the model during inference from those in training can yield poor results [Ramamurthy
et al. 2022].
Diversity & Biases of RLHF model outputs Another characteristic of RLHF models is their low entropy in output
distribution [Bai et al. 2022a], which challenges generating diverse responses [Kirk et al. 2023]. This holds true for
both seen and unseen datasets. To address this, entropy regularization techniques are introduced [Jaques et al. 2019; Li
et al. 2016] to amplify diversity in the action space, albeit not always resolving the issue [Raichuk et al. 2021]. While
not conclusive, [Bai et al. 2022a] found that while RLHF models exhibit better sentiment towards all classes, they
5

https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf

23

display similar biases to underlying LLMs when sampling with temperature < 1 (i.e., with low diversity samples). This
could be attributed to their lower entropy. Furthermore, while pre-trained models often generate probabilities that are
well-calibrated, RLHF models may lose this calibration. For instance, [OpenAI 2023] found that for pre-trained GPT-4,
the probability of generating an answer is often directly proportional to the probability of it being correct. However, in
the case of RLHF models, the distribution is skewed towards more likely answers.
Objective Misalignment While RLHF aims to align language models with human preferences and intentions, reward
model misalignment is frequently possible. For instance, Singhal et al. [2023] finds that reward models provide higher
rewards to longer outputs. Further,
Robustness and Safety It is imperative to note that the reward model is merely an imperfect proxy for real human
preferences/feedback. Due to the lack of calibration and robustness of reward models [Bai et al. 2022a], over-optimizing
against the reward model can render it an ineffective measure (Goodhart’s Law). This phenomenon, known as Reward
Overoptimization, has been studied in the context of language models by [Gao et al. 2022; Coste et al. 2023].
Further, training RLHF models in practice is very difficult for practitioners owing to unstable training [Choshen et al.
2019], hyperparameter sensitivity [Yuan et al. 2023; Rafailov et al. 2023], loading multiple models leading to high
memory usage [Santacroce et al. 2023]. As a result, there have been significant efforts to simplify the training process
by learning directly from the available feedback using simpler supervised finetuning objectives, as we discuss in
Section 7.9.
In conclusion, while RLHF substantially enhances the performance of LLMs and aligns them with human preferences,
it is not without its limitations. These include, but are not limited to, issues such as text hallucination [McKenna et al.
2023], bias and toxicity [Deshpande et al. 2023a; Ferrara 2023; Gupta et al. 2023], and the generation of harmful text
when probed [Perez et al. 2022; Wei et al. 2023]. Despite significant improvements, these models are not fully aligned
with human preferences, underscoring the need for continued research and development in this field.
7.8

Enriching Reward Signals in Reinforcement Learning

Challenges with Sparse Rewards in Traditional RL Reinforcement learning (RL) has conventionally employed
delayed and sparse rewards, where agents receive scalar feedback at the end of a trajectory or episode [Sutton and
Barto 2005]. While this approach is straightforward to implement and aligns with the task objective, it is not without its
drawbacks. Sparse rewards can lead to sample-inefficient learning due to extensive exploration requirements [Bellemare
et al. 2016]. Additionally, they may result in reward hacking, where agents exploit unintended strategies to maximize
rewards without solving the intended task [Ibarz et al. 2018]. Underspecified rewards, which do not fully capture the
desired behavior, can also yield suboptimal or degenerate solutions [Hadfield-Menell et al. 2017].
Enriching Reward Signals To mitigate the limitations of sparse rewards, researchers have explored various methods
for providing richer feedback in environments with inherently sparse rewards. These approaches include reward
shaping, where the original reward signal is augmented with additional feedback [Ng et al. 1999; Grzes 2017]; intrinsic
motivation, which encourages exploration and learning through internal rewards based on novelty, curiosity, or learning
progress [Oudeyer et al. 2007; Bellemare et al. 2016; Pathak et al. 2017]; and multi-objective optimization with
multiple reward signals [Roijers et al. 2013; Roijers 2016]. Hierarchical RL, which decomposes complex tasks into
simpler subtasks with their own reward structures, has also been investigated [Dietterich 1999; Barto and Mahadevan
2003]. Moreover, richer forms of feedback, such as learning from corrections [Jain et al. 2015; Bajcsy et al. 2017],
demonstrations [Rengarajan et al. 2022], and language feedback [Matuszek et al. 2012; Fried et al. 2017], have proven
beneficial.
Implications for RLHF in LLMs Current RLHF pipelines for LLMs primarily rely on sparse rewards provided at
the end of an episode, with reward models trained using sparse preference-based feedback. Similar challenges observed
in traditional RL have also been identified in RLHF-tuned LLMs. Some progress has been made in learning from
feedback for multi-objective optimization [Ramé et al. 2023], language feedback [Scheurer et al. 2022], corrective
feedback [Madaan et al. 2023; Shinn et al. 2023], and denser rewards [Wu et al. 2023c]. Future research should explore
the integration of these techniques to address the unique challenges in training LLMs with RLHF, potentially improving
generalization and robustness.
7.9

Moving Beyond RL Training

While RLHF has been very successful, it still results in unstable training [Choshen et al. 2019], is hyperparameter
sensitive [Yuan et al. 2023; Rafailov et al. 2023], has high memory usage [Santacroce et al. 2023] making it difficult
24

for practitioners to actually use it. As a result, there have been significant efforts to simplify the training process by
learning directly from the available feedback using simpler supervised finetuning objectives.
7.9.1

Alternatives to RL using Reward Model

Once, a reward model is trained, it is not necessary to perform the RLHF-based training. Instead, an alternate approach
during inference is to sample multiple outputs from the LLM and rank them using the reward model [Nakano et al.
2021; Cobbe et al. 2021]. This is also called best-on-n sampling or rejection sampling. If sampling multiple outputs, it
is important to ensure diversity of outputs by adjusting the sampling parameters (such as higher temperature). This
approach is often considered as either a baseline or augmented with RLHF-trained models for better inference-time
results.
Further, various works [Dong et al. 2023; Yuan et al. 2023; Song et al. 2023] use the trained reward model to rank
multiple responses and use the signal from the ranked responses to train the policy model, without using an elaborate
RL algorithm. In another line of work, RAD [Deng and Raffel 2023] uses weighted-decoding of tokens at inference,
based on a separately trained reward model.
7.9.2

Alternatives to RL without Explicit Reward Models

In this section, we discuss alternative methods to align language models with human feedback that do not rely on reward
models. While RLHF-PPO has shown promising results, it suffers from sensitivity to hyperparameters, the need for
training additional models, and potential misalignment of the reward model [Wu et al. 2023c; Rafailov et al. 2023;
Pang et al. 2022; Zhu et al. 2023b; Singhal et al. 2023]. To address these issues, recent research has explored various
techniques that directly incorporate human feedback into the training process, without relying on additional reward
models.
A straightforward approach is supervised fine-tuning on positive demonstrations from human feedback, such as
instruction-finetuned models [Ouyang et al. 2022; Chiang et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2023]. However, this method does not
utilize negative feedback, which is crucial for training robust models that can handle adversarial situations and identify
and correct errors.
Recent works, such as [Liu et al. 2023a; Zhang et al. 2023], provide both positive and negative demonstrations/feedback
and maximize the likelihood of generating positive/preferred output. These methods have shown better performance
than RLHF methods on summarization and dialogue tasks. Zhao et al. [2023] demonstrate that Sequence Likelihood
calibration (SLiC) [Zhao et al. 2022] can be used to train models on off-policy offline data collected for different models,
resulting in better performance than RLHF-based methods on summarization tasks. SLiC uses a ranking calibration
loss that contrasts positive and negative sequences while motivating the model to predict the positive class. Further,
RSO [Liu et al. 2023c] improves policy learning in SLiC by using statistical rejection sampling from the policy.
Rafailov et al. [2023]; Azar et al. [2023] further reformulate the objective encoded in the RLHF PPO algorithm, and
train the model directly on the new objective, without the need for a separate reward model. This follows the intuition,
that the policy model can be implicitly used as a reward model for training itself based on the collected feedback.
However, the results are preliminary, and extending to out-of-distribution prompts may not be possible without the
introduction of an explicit reward model.
Another line of research focuses on refining model-generated responses using human-encoded principles or feedback.
[Bai et al. 2022b; Kundu et al. 2023] propose a framework where a list of human-encoded principles (Constitution) guide
the model to critique its generations and self-refine the responses. The model is then fine-tuned on the refined responses.
Self-Align [Sun et al. 2023] follows a similar procedure but further removes the need to start with an RLHF-finetuned
model. They fine-tune the pretrained LLaMA [Touvron et al. 2023a] base model using less than 300 lines of human
feedback (in the form of constitutional principles) and achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in
terms of helpfulness and harmlessness.
Another direction of work learns to generate or select good feedback for model outputs and apply it to refine language
model outputs. [Scheurer et al. 2022] takes a similar refinement approach but utilizes available summarization feedback.
The initial model is conditioned on input, feedback, and output, generating multiple refinements. The model is then
fine-tuned on refinements with the highest similarity to human feedback. [Liu et al. 2023b] aligns human moral values
by modeling DP (dynamic-programming) based edits from unaligned source text to target aligned text. The model is
then fine-tuned on the refinements generated by the edits, using RL for the second part of the process. [Xu et al. 2022]
fine-tune a dialogue model using multi-modal feedback with the DIRECTOR method [Arora et al. 2022], which models
both negative and positive sequence labeling directly in the language model head.
25

In summary, these alternative methods generate new data based on feedback or guidelines and then use it to fine-tune
the model. These approaches reduce the reliance on reward models and have shown promising results in some tasks,
making them a viable alternative to RLHF-PPO. While these models are easier to train and help in alleviating many
drawbacks of RLHF, the evaluation performed has been performed only on specific domains, and constrained settings.
Moreover, other in-depth analysis such as sample efficiency and properties exhibited by these models, especially on
out-of-distribution data needs to be explored further.

Discussion and Conclusion

In this work, we explore the fundamental aspects of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), aiming to
clarify its mechanisms and limitations. We highlight the underlying assumptions necessary for RLHF and examine the
impact of different implementation choices, shedding light on the workings of this approach. Our analysis naturally
focuses on the reward models, which constitute the core component of RLHF. We introduce the concept of oracular
rewards, which represent the ideal reward signals that reward models should approximate. The challenges encountered
in learning these reward functions highlight both the practical and fundamental limitations of RLHF, as thoroughly
analyzed by Casper et al. [2023].
Our comprehensive review of the existing literature traces the development of RLHF from its inception to the recent
advancements. We cover various aspects: the types of feedback, the details and variations of training algorithms, and
alternative methods for achieving alignment without using reinforcement learning. In related work, Kaufmann et al.
[2023] extensively surveys RLHF, highlighting its evolution from preference-based learning.
Despite the numerous variations of RLHF, the core principle of learning from evaluative feedback remains unchanged.
This form of learning is naturally suited to reinforcement learning, while the specifics of agent formulation, the nature
of reward feedback, and environment definition continue to evolve. We anticipate the reduction of reliance on human (or
AI) feedback by using existing knowledge sources to construct rewards, which is one of the most promising directions
for future efforts to enhance the impact of RLHF. Additionally, improving reward encoding mechanisms to better reflect
the diversity of human preferences is an important area for further research.
As RLHF continues to advance and reach its full potential, supported by research in these areas, the use of LLMs
is also expanding. Until we fully understand the implications of RLHF, it is crucial to develop robust methods for
quantifying uncertainty in the outputs generated by an LLM. Such techniques would enable us to identify and address
low confidence outputs, which is especially important in safety-critical applications. Ultimately, understanding its
implications becomes paramount as advancements in RLHF increasingly influence industries and economies. Thus,
research in this field is critically important in shaping the future of large-scale language modeling and its societal
impact.
