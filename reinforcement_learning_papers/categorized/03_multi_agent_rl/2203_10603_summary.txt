**TITLE:** Model-based Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning: Recent Progress and Prospects
**ARXIV_ID:** 2203.10603v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper reviews the recent progress of model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which tackles sequential decision-making problems involving multiple participants. The authors provide a detailed taxonomy of model-based MARL algorithms, including Dyna-style, Model Predictive Control, Direct Method, and Dynamic Programming. They also analyze the pros and cons of each algorithm and discuss the challenges and opportunities in this field.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The paper provides a comprehensive review of model-based MARL, including theoretical analyses, algorithms, and applications.
* The authors propose a taxonomy of model-based MARL algorithms, which helps to organize and understand the different approaches in this field.
* The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in model-based MARL, including non-stationarity, partial observability, coordination, credit assignment, and scalability.
* The authors highlight the potential of model-based MARL in improving sample efficiency and resolving the inherent challenges in multi-agent scenarios.
* The paper identifies several research directions for future development, including scalability in centralized model-based MARL, decentralized model-based MARL with opponent modeling, and communication with learned models.
