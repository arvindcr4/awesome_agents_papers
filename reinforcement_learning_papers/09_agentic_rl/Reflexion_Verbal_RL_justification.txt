Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "arXiv:2303.11366v4 [cs.AI] 10 Oct 2023  Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning  Noah Shinn Northeastern University noahshinn024@gmail.com  Federico Cassano Northeastern University cassano.f@northeastern.edu  Edward Berman Northeastern University berman.ed@northeastern.edu  Ashwin Gopinath Massachusetts Institute of Technology agopi@mit.edu  Karthik Narasimhan Princeton University karthikn@princeton.edu  Shunyu Yao Princeton University shunyuy@princeton.edu  Abstract Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to interact with external environments (e.g., games, compilers, APIs) as goal-driven agents."
- "However, it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and efficiently learn from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning methods require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 09_agentic_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as agent, tool, web, matching the research direction's core themes.
