**TITLE:** BenchMARL: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2312.01472v3
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** BenchMARL is a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) training library that enables standardized benchmarking across different algorithms, models, and environments. It uses TorchRL as its backend, providing high performance and state-of-the-art implementations. The library allows for systematic configuration and reporting, making it easy to create and run complex benchmarks from simple one-line inputs.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of BenchMARL, the first MARL benchmarking library
* Enables standardized benchmarking across different algorithms, models, and environments
* Uses TorchRL as its backend for high performance and state-of-the-art implementations
* Allows for systematic configuration and reporting
* Supports vectorized environments for improved performance
* Provides an easy-to-use tool for users approaching MARL for the first time
* Enables comparison and sharing of MARL components, increasing reproducibility in the field and reducing costs.
