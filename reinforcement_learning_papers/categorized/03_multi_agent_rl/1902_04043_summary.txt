**PAPER:** The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge
**TITLE:** The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge
**ARXIV_ID:** 1902.04043v5
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) is a benchmark problem for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that focuses on decentralized micromanagement tasks in the real-time strategy game StarCraft II. SMAC consists of a set of diverse combat scenarios that challenge MARL methods to handle partial observability and high-dimensional inputs. The goal is to maximize the win rate for each battle scenario.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces SMAC as a benchmark problem for cooperative MARL
* Provides a set of diverse combat scenarios for evaluating MARL methods
* Offers recommendations for reporting evaluations using standardized performance metrics
* Includes a thorough report and discussion of several state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, such as QMIX and COMA
* Open-sources PyMARL, a framework for designing and analyzing deep MARL algorithms
