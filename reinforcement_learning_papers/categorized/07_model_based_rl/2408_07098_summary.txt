**TITLE:** QTypeMix: Enhancing Multi-Agent Cooperative Strategies through Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Value Decomposition
**ARXIV_ID:** 2408.07098v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** QTypeMix is a novel type-related Value Function Factorization (VFF) method that divides the value decomposition process into homogeneous and heterogeneous stages based on agent types. It uses a multi-head attention mechanism and hypernetworks to enhance the representation capability and achieve the value decomposition process. The method also extracts type-related observation embeddings from each agent's historical observations to guide the value decomposition process.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a novel dual-layer VFF method, QTypeMix, which introduces type information to improve the value decomposition process.
* Divides the value decomposition process into homogeneous and heterogeneous stages based on agent types.
* Uses a multi-head attention mechanism and hypernetworks to enhance the representation capability and achieve the value decomposition process.
* Extracts type-related observation embeddings from each agent's historical observations to guide the value decomposition process.
* Achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios, including StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and SMACv2.
