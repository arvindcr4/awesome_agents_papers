**TITLE:** Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Networked Agents: Recent Advances
**ARXIV_ID:** 1912.03821v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper reviews recent advances in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with networked agents. The authors focus on MARL algorithms that concern this setting and are backed by theoretical analysis. They discuss the challenges of MARL, including handling equilibrium points, non-stationarity, scalability issues, and information structure. The paper also presents various algorithms for learning policies and policy evaluation in decentralized MARL, including QD-learning, actor-critic algorithms, and distributed TD learning.
