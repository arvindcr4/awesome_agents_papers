**PAPER:** When Do Curricula Work in Federated Learning?
**TITLE:** When Do Curricula Work in Federated Learning?
**ARXIV_ID:** 2212.12712v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper investigates the effectiveness of curriculum learning in federated learning settings. The authors propose a novel framework for curriculum learning in federated learning, where clients learn from a curriculum of data samples that are ordered by difficulty. They also introduce a new scoring function that takes into account the loss value of each data sample. The authors evaluate their approach on several datasets and federated learning algorithms, and show that curriculum learning can improve the accuracy and convergence of federated learning models, especially in non-IID settings.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a novel framework for curriculum learning in federated learning settings.
* They introduce a new scoring function that takes into account the loss value of each data sample.
* They evaluate their approach on several datasets and federated learning algorithms, and show that curriculum learning can improve the accuracy and convergence of federated learning models, especially in non-IID settings.
* They provide theoretical analysis and convergence guarantees for their approach.
* They investigate the effect of pacing function and its parameters on the accuracy of curriculum learning in federated learning.
* They propose a client selection technique that leverages the heterogeneity of clients in federated learning.
