**PAPER:** Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning
**TITLE:** Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1706.05296v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper introduces a novel approach to cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where a single joint reward signal is provided to the agents. The authors propose a value-decomposition network architecture, which learns to decompose the team value function into agent-wise value functions. This approach is designed to address the challenges of cooperative multi-agent learning, including the "lazy agent" problem and spurious rewards.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a value-decomposition network architecture, which learns to decompose the team value function into agent-wise value functions.
* They evaluate the approach on a range of partially-observable multi-agent domains and show that it leads to superior results compared to centralized and independent learning approaches.
* The authors also investigate the benefits of additional enhancements, including weight sharing, role information, and information channels, and show that these can further improve the performance of the value-decomposition approach.
* The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the approach, including plots of average reward and confidence intervals for different architectures and domains.
