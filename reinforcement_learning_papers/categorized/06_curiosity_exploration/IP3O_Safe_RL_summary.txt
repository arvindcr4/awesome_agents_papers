**TITLE:** Educational impacts of generative artificial intelligence on learning and performance of engineering students in China
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 06_curiosity_exploration (The paper explores the use of generative AI in education, specifically in engineering education in China)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The study employed a questionnaire survey to examine the use of generative AI among Chinese engineering students, evaluating their perceptions, summarizing their encountered challenges, and exploring its potential future integration into engineering curricula in higher education.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The study provides insights into the current use of generative AI among Chinese engineering students and its impact on their learning experience.
* The results show that generative AI has a positive impact on learning efficiency, with 88.52% of respondents reporting improved productivity.
* The study highlights the challenges faced by Chinese engineering students in using generative AI, including the inaccuracy of AI-generated content, over-reliance on AI tools, and concerns about data privacy and ethics.
* The paper emphasizes the need for educators to develop clear guidelines, create tailored integration plans, and offer comprehensive training programs covering technical, practical, and ethical aspects of generative AI.
* The study suggests that generative AI has the potential to enhance engineering education, but its application faces several challenges that need to be addressed.
