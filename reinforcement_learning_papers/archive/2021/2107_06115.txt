ABSTRACT
Inefficient traffic signal control methods may cause numerous problems, such as traffic
congestion and waste of energy. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a trending data-driven
approach for adaptive traffic signal control in complex urban traffic networks. Although
the development of deep neural networks (DNN) further enhances its learning capability,
there are still some challenges in applying deep RLs to transportation networks with
multiple signalized intersections, including non-stationarity environment, explorationexploitation dilemma, multi-agent training schemes, continuous action spaces, etc. In
order to address these issues, this paper first proposes a multi-agent deep deterministic
policy gradient (MADDPG) method by extending the actor-critic policy gradient
algorithms. MADDPG has a centralized learning and decentralized execution paradigm
in which critics use additional information to streamline the training process, while actors
act on their own local observations. The model is evaluated via simulation on the
Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform. Model comparison results show the
efficiency of the proposed algorithm in controlling traffic lights.

INTRODUCTION
Traffic signal control is an efficient method of protecting traffic participants at
intersections where multiple streams of traffic interact. Because of the capability of
responding to fluctuating traffic demands, the adaptive signal control technology has
been broadly implemented, and has attracted considerable interest in the research
community (Wu et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2018; van de Weg et al., 2018). By receiving and
processing data from strategically placed sensors, adaptative control works based on realtime traffic dynamics about travel demand and traffic conditions and performance
measurements of the control logic, such as traffic volume, queue length, travel speed and
travel time (Wang, Huang and Lo, 2019). Compared to the fixed-time control, adaptive
signal control has been proved to improve the quality of service that travelers experience
on roadways, especially in busy urban areas, while reducing travel time by more than
10% on average (USDOT, 2017). However, inefficient adaptive control strategies can
also cause numerous problems, such as forcing frustrated commuters to wait in
congestion, resulting in more gasoline waste and air pollution, and even incurring
vehicular accidents (Zhao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019).
Numerous interdisciplinary approaches have been applied to improve the
efficiency of adaptive signal control in the past two decades, including but not limited to
fuzzy logic (Cheng et al., 2016), case-based reasoning (De Schutter et al., 2003;
Elkosantini, Mnif and Chabchoub, 2011), artificial neural networks (Adeli and Samant,
2000; Ghanim and Abu-Lebdeh, 2015), genetic algorithm (Odeh et al., 2015), and
immune network algorithm (Darmoul et al., 2017; Louati et al., 2018). Among these
technologies, reinforcement learning (RL), developed under the framework of Markov
decision process (MDP), is a promising approach to learn adaptive signal control based
on real-world traffic measurements. Different with conventional model-driven
approaches or supervised learning algorithms, reinforcement learning is a type of goaloriented algorithm, which learns how to achieve complex objectives (i.e., optimal
control) in specific dimensions through many steps by learning from the experience
interacting with complex transportation systems (Li, 2017).
As shown in Fig.1, in the RL framework for an isolated traffic signal control, the
signal light is treated as an agent, and interacts with the traffic environment (i.e., traffic
conditions) in a closed-loop MDP. The control policy is obtained by mapping from the
traffic states (e.g., waiting time, queue length, total delay, etc.) to the corresponding
optimal control actions (e.g., phase shift, cycle length change, green time increase, etc.).
The agent iteratively receives a feedback reward for actions taken and adjusts the policy
until it converges to the optimal control policy (El-Tantawy, Abdulhai and Abdelgawad,
2013). During the decision process, the policy that the agent takes combines both the
exploitation of already learned policy and exploration of new policy that never met
before. The RL algorithms can also be extended to a transportation network with multiple
intersections. As the other settings remain the same, the goal of traffic signal agents
changes to learn the optimal policies of each agent and to optimize the traffic condition of
the whole traffic environment simultaneously. Studies using RLs to manipulate traffic
signals are not rare in the last decade and have provided beneficial references for research
(Abdulhai, Pringle and Karakoulas, 2003; Arel et al., 2010; Prashanth and Bhatnagar,
2010).

FIGURE 1. Reinforcement learning framework for traffic light control
With recent vast developments in the field of deep learning, we have been
witnessing the renaissance of reinforcement learning, especially, the combination of deep
neural networks (DNNs) and reinforcement learning, i.e., deep reinforcement learning
(Schmidhuber, 2015). Deep RL has been prevailing in last several years with different
applications, such as resources management in computer clusters (Mao et al., 2016),
games (Mnih et al., 2013), natural language processing (NLP) (Young et al., 2018),
robotics (Kober, Bagnell and Peters, 2013), web system configuration (Bu, Rao and Xu,
2009), personalized recommendations (Wang et al., 2014), etc. Deep RLs significantly
outperform the traditional RLs since the deep learning architecture enables it to scale to
decision-making problems that were previously intractable (Arulkumaran et al., 2017).
Considerable research efforts have been devoted to using deep RLs to solve operational
problems in the domain of adaptive signal control in the past few years (Genders and
Razavi, 2016; Li, Lv and Wang, 2016; Mousavi, Schukat and Howley, 2017). There are
three major model-free deep RL approaches, including methods based on value functions,
methods based on policy search, and methods which employ both value functions and
policy search, namely actor-critic (AC) approach. More specifically, value function
methods, for instance, Q-learning and state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA)
algorithms, attempt to find a policy that maximizes the return by maintaining a set of
estimates of expected returns for some policies (Zhao and Eskenazi, 2016). The stateaction-value is updated by efficient bootstrapping, i.e., using current values of the
estimate of the state-action-value to improve the estimate. These methods bear the flaws
in practice due to the good convergence requires a stationary MDP transition, which is
less likely in the domain of adaptive signal control. In addition, the policy degradation
issue, i.e., current policy may still be far from optimal even if the value function
estimation is already exceptionally accurate (Kakade and Langford, 2002). On contrast,
policy search methods do not need to maintain a value function model, but directly search
for an optimal policy. These methods assumed that the policy is stochastic and follows a
parameterized distribution. This treatment enables these methods can learn stochastic
policies and be effective in high-dimensional or continuous action spaces. However, the
drawbacks are also significant, i.e., evaluating a policy is typically inefficient and high
variance, and moreover, these methods always converge to a local rather than global
optimum (Busoniu et al., 2017). The actor-critic methods have grown in popularity as an
4

effective means of combining value function with an explicit representation of the policy,
and use the value function as a baseline for policy gradients. The fundamental difference
between actor-critic methods and other baseline methods are that the former utilizes
benefits of policy search methods with learned value function, which are able to learn
from full returns and/or temporal difference (TD) errors (Schmidhuber, 2015). Recent
papers have demonstrated that the actor-critic methods outperform other deep RLs in
various applications (Lillicrap et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2017).
Although DNN significantly improves the applicability of RLs, there are still
some challenges in applying deep RLs to transportation networks with multiple
signalized intersections, including non-stationarity environment, exploration-exploitation
dilemma, multi-agent training schemes, continuous action spaces, etc. The following
contents will detailed describe these challenges. Firstly, in a single agent environment, an
intersection only needs to concern the outcome of its individual actions. However, in the
network domain, an intersection not only needs to observe the outcome of its own actions
but also the behaviors of other intersections. In addition, all intersections are not
homogeneous in real world since each intersection has different geometric characteristics,
traffic components and volumes. The procedure is further complex because all
intersections potentially need to interact with others and learn their actions concurrently.
Therefore, this is a moving-target learning problem, i.e., learning among intersections
may cause changes in the policy of an agent, and can affect the optimal policy of others.
The estimated potential rewards on the action will be inaccurate, and thus a good strategy
at a given point in the multi-agent setup will not be retained in the future, i.e., the optimal
control policy of one intersection may not the networkwide optimal policy. At this
condition, the traffic environment becomes non-stationary, and the Markov property no
longer exists in this environment. This poses a huge challenge to the direct use of past
experience replays, making Q-learning problematic to stabilize in such a multi-agent
environment. On the other hand, policy gradient methods usually have a very high
variance when multiple agents need to be coordinated (Lowe et al., 2017).
In addition, collecting and processing information must be repeated to some
extent, while ensuring that it does not affect the stability of the agent. Further
complications of the exploration-exploitation dilemma arise due to the presence of
multiple agents. The exploration-exploitation trade-off requires online RL algorithms that
balance between the exploitation of the agent’s current knowledge with exploratory
information gathering actions taken to improve that knowledge (Buşoniu, Babuška and
De Schutter, 2010). Agents have to not only explore information about the environment,
but also the information of other agents in order to adapt to their behaviors. However, too
much exploration can undermine the stability of other agents and affect the efficiency of
the algorithm, making it more difficult to explore the agent’s learning tasks.
Besides, most previous studies that directly extended the single agent deep RL to
multi-agent environment is to learn each agent independently by considering other agents
as part of the environment (Tampuu et al., 2017). Due to structural limitations of
traditional RLs, the method is prone to overfitting and is computationally expensive, and
thus the number of agents involved is limited. Therefore, it is not surprising that those
early attempts were only primarily aimed at controlling traffic on isolated intersections or
small transportation networks with special attention on arterials (Bingham, 2001; Balaji,
5

German and Srinivasan, 2010). An alternative and popular approach is to use centralized
learning and decentralized execution, where a group of agents can apply a centralized
approach to training through open communication channels (Kraemer and Banerjee,
2016). The advantages of decentralized polices lie especially on partial observability and
limited communication of agents. Centralized learning of decentralized strategies has
become a standard paradigm for multi-agent setups because the learning process can be
without communication constraints and additional state information can be obtained
(Foerster et al., 2018).
A recent paper introduced a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient
(MADDPG) method based on the actor-critic policy gradient algorithms (Lowe et al.,
2017). MADDPG has a centralized learning and decentralized execution paradigm in
which critics use additional information to streamline the training process, while actors
act on their own local observations. This framework perfectly solves the networkwide
adaptive traffic signal control problems which are difficult to be handled with other deep
RLs, such as deep Q-learning (Zeng, Hu and Zhang, 2018), actor-critic (Wang et al.,
2016), etc. More specifically, the action value functions are learned in a centralized
manner, implying that the actions of all intersections can be taken into account
concurrently. Thus, the algorithm learns a collection of policies for each agent, rather
than individual policies of a single agent. In each episode of the learning process, each
intersection uniformly extracts a control policy from its ensemble. This treatment
significantly reduces the non-stationarity caused by multiple agents learning
simultaneously. In addition, at execution time the learned policies can only use local
information (i.e., their own observations), so that the policies can be used by each agent
without relying on further communication, which can significantly reduce the
computational burden. In addition, previous deep RLs always assume the environment is
discrete or differentiable, while the assumption is contrary to the real-world traffic
environment dynamics. These advantages allow the MADDPG algorithm to formulate
the adaptive traffic signal control problems in the traffic network environment consisting
of both cooperative and competitive agents.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that formulates MADDPG for
adaptive traffic signal control, by extending the algorithm of actor-critic policy gradient
methods (specifically deep deterministic policy gradient, DDPG). In order to develop a
robust and efficient control framework, several techniques are further proposed to deal
with the issues arose by the multi-agent environment. We assume traffic conditions can
be obtained by loop detectors, and different intersections can share their information. By
this means, actions taken by all the others are known to each individual agent, thus the
environment is stationary as the policies change. In addition, to reduce the computational
burden and resolve the potential communication failure between agents, we relax the
common assumption in other RLs that each agent’s policies are always known to others.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In the Methodology Section, we first
review the classical reinforcement learning algorithms, and then we carefully state our
proposed MADDPG algorithm. In the Numerical Experiments Section, the proposed
algorithm is evaluated by a real-world traffic network in Montgomery County, Maryland.
Finally, the paper is concluded in the Conclusion Section.

METHODOLOGY
Problem Statement
We consider a road network with 𝑁(𝑁 > 1) intersections, and each intersection has
multiple lanes. Our goal is to find an optimal traffic control strategy with the aim of
maximizing throughput in this network, i.e., the number of vehicles that have completed
their trips in the road network during throughout a period. We formulated the problem in
a reinforcement learning framework with four main components including: reward, state,
action, and coordination strategy. A four-tuple < 𝒮, 𝒜, ℛ, 𝑇 > is used to define the RL
model, where 𝒮 is the possible state space, 𝒜 is the possible action space, 𝑅 denotes the
reward space, and 𝒯 is the transition function space among all states. An agent is an
action executor that obtains a numerical reward by taking actions based on the
environment and current state. The reward is the goal in a reinforcement learning
problem. Equivalently, RL can be treated as an optimization method for the target which
is specified as a reward function in the RL context. The agent takes an action according
to the environment at each decision point, and the environment sends the reward back to
the agent. In the long run, the agent’s goal is to maximize the objective rewards through
trial and error. A policy is built up of a series of consequent actions. The goal of
reinforcement learning is to learn an optimal policy and maximize the cumulative
expected rewards from the initial state.
In the network-wide traffic signal control problem, each signal light in the
intersection is treated as an agent. The following contents give a description of actions,
states, and rewards in this network. At each time step, the agent receives some
quantitative information of the environment as the state representation. We assume that
all intersections are equipped with near-intersection loop detectors which can detect realtime traffic conditions and send this information to the signal control center. Therefore,
the traffic state data such as queue lengths, flow rate, vehicle speed, etc., can be easily
obtained. In this study, we select two easily measurable elements including waiting time
and volume as key indexes of the state of agents. The waiting time of a vehicle is defined
as the time period a vehicle during which the vehicle is in a waiting status, i.e., the status
that the vehicle with a speed of less than 0.1 m/s. The volume of a lane is defined as the
number of vehicles on the lane, which equals to the sum of queueing vehicles and moving
vehicles on the lane. More specifically, the state of intersection 𝑖 at time 𝑡 is defined as a
two-value vector 𝑠!,# =< ∑ 𝑤!,# [𝑙] , ∑ 𝑓!,# [𝑙 ] >, ∀𝑙, where 𝑤!,# [𝑙] is the waiting time for
the first vehicle in the each incoming lane 𝑙, and 𝑓!,# [𝑙 ] is the flow rate of lane 𝑙.
Different action schemes have significant impacts on the performance of traffic signal
control strategies. In current adaptive control algorithms, such as SCOOT and SCATS,
there are several different control strategies, for instance, phase shift, phase length
change, phase itself, etc., or a combination of some of the above. However, a complicated
action design may considerably increase the computational burden. In this study, we
follow the conventional adaptive control settings and define the action of each agent as
phase switch. More specifically, the agent could choose one phase from the set of all
feasible phases, in which the phase sequence is not predetermined. Consequently, this
type of signal timing is more flexible, and the agent is learning to select the stage to
change without assuming that the signal will change in a round-robin method.

Due to the complex spatial-temporal structure of traffic data, the reward should be
spatially decomposable and can be easily measured after an action. Besides, since our
primary goal is to maximize the total throughput of the network, the reward here is
defined with two components, including the queue length and the sum of waiting time of
vehicles on each individual incoming lane. In addition, different priorities could be
assigned according to the traffic volume or emergency situations if needed. Let 𝐿$
indicate the set of lanes on the roads that need to be assigned higher priority, then the
reward of the intersection 𝑖 at time 𝑡 can be written as 𝑟!,# = −𝑎% =∑)∈+!,# 𝑎& 𝑞!'∆!,# [𝑙 ] +
∑)∉+!,# 𝑏& 𝑞!'∆!,# [𝑙 ]A − 𝑏% =∑)∈+!,# 𝑎& 𝑤!'∆!,# [𝑙] + ∑)∉+!,# 𝑏& 𝑤!'∆!,# [𝑙]A, where 𝑞!'∆!,# [𝑙 ] is
the sum of queue length over each approaching lane 𝑙, 𝑎% , 𝑎& , 𝑏% , 𝑏& are non-negative
parameters, 𝑎& ≥ 𝑏& , and 𝑎& + 𝑏& = 1. It is worth noting that since the reward is postdecision and thus both the two components are measured at time 𝑡 + ∆𝑡 instead of at time
𝑡.
There are various algorithmic frameworks for RL methods from different
perspectives. The RL method can be classified into a value-based method or a policy
gradient method, respectively, depending on whether it is a learning value function or an
explicit learning strategy parameter. The following content first reviews some classical
reinforcement learning algorithms, and then proposes improved algorithms based on
these algorithms to solve our problems.
Background
A. Multi-agent Extension of Markov Decision Processes
A multi-agent extension of Markov decision processes called partially observable
Markov games is considered in this study (Littman, 1994). A Markov game for multiple
𝑁 (𝑁 > 1) agents is defined by a set of states 𝒮, a set of actions, 𝒜 = {𝒜% , … , 𝒜- }, and
a set of observations 𝒪 = {𝒪% , … , 𝒪- }, one for each agent on the environment. State
transitions are controlled by the current state and one action from each agent:
𝒯: 𝒮 × 𝒜% × … × 𝒜- ↦ PD(𝒮). Each agent also has an associated reward function,
ℛ# : 𝒮 × 𝒜% × … × 𝒜- ↦ ℜ, and receives a private observation correlated with the state
𝒐# : 𝒮 ↦ 𝒪# . The initial states are determined by a distribution 𝜌: 𝒮 ↦ [0,1]. Each agent 𝑖
aims to maximize its expected sum of discounted rewards, 𝑅# = ∑.!/0 𝛾 ! 𝑟#! , where 𝛾 is a
discount factor, 𝑇 is the time horizon, and 𝑟#! is the reward received by agent 𝑖.
B. Q-learning and Deep Q-networks
Q-learning is a fundamental RL method that fits the Q-function with a parametric
model 𝑄1 . The action-value function in Q-learning for policy 𝝅 is given as 𝑄𝝅 (𝑠, 𝑎) =
𝔼[𝑅|𝑠 ! = 𝑠, 𝑎! = 𝑎]. This Q function can be recursively rewritten as 𝑄𝝅 (𝑠, 𝑎) =
𝔼3$ W𝑟(𝑠, 𝑎) + 𝛾𝔼4$ ~𝝅 [𝑄𝝅 (𝑠 6 , 𝑎6 )]X. On the other hand, deep Q-networks (DQN) learns
the action-value function 𝑄∗ corresponding to the optimal policy by minimizing the loss:
ℒ(𝜃) = 𝔼3,4,8,3$ [(𝑄∗ (𝑠, 𝑎|𝜃) − 𝑦)& ], where 𝑦 = 𝑟 + 𝛾 max 𝑄_∗ (𝑠 6 , 𝑎6 )
(1)
4$

8

where 𝑄_ is a target Q function whose parameters are intermittently updated with the latest
𝜃, which helps to stabilize learning.
The multi-agent extension of Q-learning can be achieved by having each agent 𝑖
learning an independently optimal function 𝑄# (Tan, 1993). However, as aforementioned,
since the agent independently updates its policies during the learning process, the
environment seems to be non-stationary from the perspective of any agent, violating the
Markov assumptions required for convergence of Q-learning. Another difficulty is that
the experience replay buffer cannot be used in such a setting since in general,
𝑃(𝑠 6 |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝝅% , … , 𝝅- ) ≠ 𝑃(𝑠 6 |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝝅%6 , … , 𝝅6- ) when any 𝝅# ≠ 𝝅6# .
C. Policy Gradient Algorithms
The major idea of policy gradient (PG) algorithms is to directly adjust the parameters
𝜃 of the policy in order to maximize the objective 𝐽(𝜃) = 𝔼3~$𝝅 ,4~𝝅& [𝑅 ] by taking steps
in the direction of ∇1 𝐽(𝜃). Using the Q function defined previously, the gradient of the
policy can be written as:
∇1 𝐽(𝜃) = 𝔼3~$𝝅 ,4~𝝅& [∇1 log 𝝅1 (𝑎|𝑠)𝑄𝝅 (𝑠, 𝑎)]

(2)

where 𝑝𝝅 is the state distribution. There are several methods to estimate 𝑄𝝅 , resulting in
different practical algorithms, for instance, REINFORCE (Duan et al., 2016), actor-critic
(Konda and Tsitsiklis, 2000), etc. Specifically, the actor-critic algorithm uses an
approximation, 𝑄9 (𝑠, 𝑎), to estimate the true action-value function 𝑄𝝅 (𝑠, 𝑎).
The multi-agent extension of PG algorithms also faces various challenges. In a multiagent environment, since the reward of an individual agent is usually associated with the
actions of other agents, the reward conditioned only on the agent’s own actions (when the
agent's optimization process does not consider the actions of other agents) exhibits much
more variability, therefore increasing the variance of its gradients (Buşoniu, Babuška and
De Schutter, 2010; Lowe et al., 2017). Other algorithms that typically used to moderate
high variance, for instance, actor-critic with baseline, are also problematic in multi-agent
settings due to non-stationarity issues aforementioned (Foerster et al., 2018).
D. Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms
A recent extension of the policy gradient framework using deterministic policies
𝜇1 : 𝒮 ↦ 𝒜, named deterministic policy gradient (DPG), combined the benefits of DQN
and actor-critic algorithms (Silver et al., 2014). In particular, if the action space 𝒜 and
the policy 𝝁 are continuous (then the Q-function is presumed to be differentiable with
respect to the action argument), the gradient of the objective 𝐽(𝜃) = 𝔼3~$𝝁 [𝑅(𝑠, 𝑎)] can
be rewritten as:
∇1 𝐽(𝜃) = 𝔼3~𝒟 W∇1 𝝁1 (𝑎|𝑠)∇4 𝑄𝝁 (𝑠, 𝑎)|4/<& (3) X

(3)

One of the major advantages of DPGs is that although stochastic policy gradients are
integrated in both state and action spaces, DPGs are only integrated over the state space,
requiring fewer samples in problems with large action spaces. Previous studies have
shown that DPG greatly improves the stochastic policy gradient equivalence in highdimensional continuous control problems (Silver et al., 2014).
9

By integrating DNN, later work introduced Deep DPG (DDPG), which uses deep
neural networks to concurrently approximate the policy 𝝁 and critic-function 𝑄𝝁 . It is
also an off-policy algorithm, and can be thought of as being deep Q-learning for
continuous action spaces.
Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms (MADDPG)
Considering the studied multi-intersection environment, each intersection is both
cooperating and competing with other intersections simultaneously, resulting a mixedcooperative-competitive environment. As aforementioned, the naïve policy gradient
methods do not have outstanding performance in such a multi-agent environment, since
the policies of each agent are unstable and the environment is non-stationary for each
agent. That is, 𝑃(𝑠 6 |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜋% , … , 𝜋- ) ≠ 𝑃(𝑠 6 |𝑠, 𝑎, 𝜋%6 , … , 𝜋-6 ) for any 𝜋# ≠ 𝜋#6 . To some
extent, it does not make sense for agents to optimize their policies based on this unstable
environment state. Policies that are optimized in the current state may not be effective in
the next changed environment state. These problems are indeed caused by the fact that
there is no interaction between the agents, and they do not know what policies the
“teammates” or “opponents” will adopt, resulting in the selection of actions only
according to their own circumstances, while ignoring the whole environment. Naturally, a
promising way to solve this problem is to propose an algorithm that can take advantage
of the information of other agents.
In the article of Lowe et al. (2017), the authors adopted a framework of centralized
training with decentralized execution. The proposed algorithm can be regarded as a
multi-agent extension of the actor-critic policy gradient methods where the critic is
augmented with extra information about the policies of other agents. More specifically, in
a game with 𝑁 agents with policies parametrized by 𝜽 = {𝜃% , … , 𝜃- }, and let 𝝅 =
{𝝅% , … , 𝝅- } be the set of all agent policies. The gradient of the expected return for agent
𝑖, 𝐽(𝜃# ) = 𝔼[𝑅# ], can be written as:
∇1# 𝐽(𝜃# ) = 𝔼3~$𝝁 ,4# ~𝝅# W∇1 # log 𝝅# (𝑎# |𝑜# )𝑄#𝝅 (x, 𝑎% , … , 𝑎- )X

(4)

where 𝑎% , … , 𝑎- are the 𝑁 agents, and 𝑄#𝝅 (x, 𝑎% , … , 𝑎- ) is the centralized action-value
function that takes as input of all these agents and state information x, and outputs the Qvalue for agent 𝑖. It can be seen in Eq. (4), each 𝑄#𝝅 is learned separately. Thus, agents can
have indiscriminate reward structures, and even resulting in rewards confliction in
competitive environments.
In order to let the above algorithm more accommodate to multi-agent settings, we can
extend this idea by introducing deterministic policies. Let 𝝁# be continuous policies with
respect to parameters 𝜽# , then Eq. (4) can be written as
𝝁
∇1# 𝐽(𝜇# ) = 𝔼?,4~𝒟 W∇1 # 𝝁# (𝑎# |𝑜# )∇4# 𝑄# (x, 𝑎% , … , 𝑎- )|4# /𝝁# (@# ) X
(5)
where 𝒟 indicates the experience reply buffer and contains the tuples
(x, x 6 , 𝑎% , … , 𝑎- , 𝑟% , … , 𝑟- ), recording experiences of all agents. The centralized action𝝁
value function 𝑄# is updated as:
𝝁

ℒ(𝜃# ) = 𝔼?,4,8,?$ no𝑄# (x, 𝑎% , … , 𝑎- ) − 𝑦p q

𝑦 = 𝑟# + 𝛾𝑄# (x 6 , 𝑎%6 , … , 𝑎4($ /𝝁$( (@( )

(6b)

where 𝝁6 = r𝝁1)$ , … , 𝝁1*$ s is the set of target policies with delayed parameters 𝜃#6 .
In order to obtain multi-agent policies that are more robust to changes in the policy of
other agents in this mixed-cooperative-competitive environment, a collection of 𝐾
different sub-policies is trained. At each episode, one particular sub-policy is randomly
selected for each agent to execute. Suppose that policy 𝝁# is an ensemble of 𝐾 different
sub-policies with sub-policy 𝑘 denoted by 𝝁A# . For agent 𝑖, we are then maximizing the
ensemble objective: 𝐽B (𝝁# ) = 𝔼A~CDEF(%,G),3~$𝝁 ,4~𝝁+ [𝑅# (𝑠, 𝑎)]. Since different sub-policies
#

will be executed in different episodes, we maintain a replay buffer 𝒟#A for each subpolicy 𝝁A# of agent 𝑖. Accordingly, we can derive the gradient of the ensemble objective
with respective to 𝜃#A as follows:
%

∇1 (A)
𝐽B (𝝁# ) = G 𝔼?,4~𝒟 (+) n∇1 (A)
𝝁A# (𝑎# |𝑜# )∇4# 𝑄𝝁# (x, 𝑎% , … , 𝑎- )|4# /𝝁+(@#) q

The detailed learning schemes and algorithm procedure are shown in Fig. 2 and
Algorithm 1, respectively.

NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
General Setups
The proposed MADDPG algorithm is evaluated in the Simulation of Urban MObility
(SUMO) simulation platform, using a real-world complex traffic network extracted from
Montgomery County, Maryland (as shown in Fig. 3). SUMO is an open-source traffic
simulation package designed by the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German
Aerospace Center to handle large road networks (Krajzewicz et al., 2012). The multiagent extension of the OpenAI Gym framework is utilized to setup the simulated
environment (Brockman et al., 2016). We used Python APIs provided by SUMO to
convert the network from Open Street Map, and detailed intersection structures are
shown in Fig. 4. In order to test the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed
MADDPG algorithm, the traffic demand data consisting both PM peak hours (17:3018:00) and congestion recovery hours (18:00-18:30) are used as the input to simulate the
recurrent congestion situation. The daily Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are extracted
from the Montgomery-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and the traffic
volumes are obtained from Maryland Department of Transportation and utilized to
estimate the OD matrix from the raw daily OD matrices. For the unsignalized
intersections, the default control logic in SUMO are utilized. In the simulation setting, the
maximal speed of a vehicle is 60 mile/h, and the maximal acceleration and deceleration
rates are 3.3 feet/s & and 15 feet/s & , respectively. The duration of yellow signals is set to
be 4 seconds.

FIGURE 4. Detailed Traffic Network Structure
The MADDPG algorithm is trained in episodes, and different random seeds are
used for generating different training and evaluation episode. The length of training and
13

control step is one second, and thus, one episode contains totally 3,600 training steps. As
shown in Fig. 5, the deep neural network architecture of our proposed MADDPG consists
two networks, i.e., the actor network 𝜋 and the critic network 𝑄. The actor network
receives the current transportation state obtained by loop detectors and outputs the
actions. More specifically, it starts with several fully connected layers with non-linear
Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activations (Maas, Hannun and Ng, 2013). Thus, the
width of the network is the same as the traffic light phases. A batch normalization layer
and another fully connected layer with ReLU activation is designed following the lastmentioned layer to scale the output into a reasonable range. In addition, noise is injected
as another layer prior to phase adjustment to keep exploration. The critic network
receives the current state of simulation and actions generated by all agents, and outputs
the Q-values associated to them. Like the actor, it is comprised of several fully connected
layers with leaky ReLU activations, and a final fully connected layer with linear
activation. Detailed hyperparameters of the MADDPG algorithm are presented in Table
1.

The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the fixed time
traffic controls and two well-trained state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms in a
simulation replication with the same random state, including DQN (Li, Lv and Wang,
2016) and DDPG (Casas, 2017). In the DQN implementation, a centralized control
method is designed, i.e., an agent manages all intersections simultaneously. On the other
hand, the network architectures used in DDPG is the same as those in MADDPG. To
ensure fair comparison, all controllers have the same action space, state space, and
interaction frequency. In addition, different hyperparameters for benchmarks are tested
for several times to ensure adequate performance, and fine-tuned values are injected in
the two models. Finally, all algorithms are trained with 1,000 episodes.
Experiment Results
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the average reward of all episodes for MADDPG, DQN, and
DDPG algorithms are -48.0, -79.5, and -152.9, respectively. On the other hand, the
maximum reward for these three algorithms are -14.0, -26.9, and -39.73, respectively. In
addition, MADDPG remains remarkably stable once it reached its peak performance,
while the other two are unstable and difficult to converge. Therefore, it is clearly that
MADDPG outperforms others for this given objective. The reason is that Q-learning is
difficult to maintain stable in such a non-stationary environment, while DDPG is
challenged by the high variance when multiple intersections need to be coordinated
simultaneously.
The average queue lengths and delays per vehicle networkwide for different
algorithms are shown in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c). All these comparison results are extracted
from the best preformed episode of these algorithms. The average queue lengths for
MADDPG, DQN, DDPG, and fixed time controllers are 0.8 veh, 2.3 veh, 5.0 veh, and
9.8 veh, respectively. The average delays for the four controllers are 5.2 s/veh, 9.06
s/veh, 13.4 s/veh, and 21.2 s/veh, respectively. It should be noted that even though the
traffic volumes and ODs are the same for all these controllers, the trends of queue lengths
and delays are different because the controllers generated different control strategies.
These results show that all reinforcement learning algorithms have better control
performance than the fixed time control, and have the abilities to recover from
congestion. As contrast, the fixed time control has the worst performance, and the queues
are difficult to mitigate even though the traffic volume becomes lower at the last 30
minutes. Among all these deep RL algorithms, MADDPG provides the most stable
control policy since it has the smallest variance, and has the shortest average queue
length and smallest average delay.

The throughputs for different algorithms are presented in Fig. 6(d). The flow rate
is aggregated into one minute to provide significant comparison results. It can be seen
that at the first beginning, there are not many differences of traffic throughput between
the four controllers. However, in the middle part of the simulation (20-40min),
MADDPG has the largest output flow beating all others, while fixed time control has the
smallest flow rate and thus fails to quickly eliminate congestions. In the last part of the
simulation, MADDPG still stays ahead but the advantage is not particularly obvious.
Totally, in this one-hour simulation, 6118, 5596, 5511, and 4977 vehicles finished their
trips under the control of MADDPG, DQN, DDPG, and fixed time, respectively. These
results also evidenced that our proposed model has better performance than other peers.

CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS
In this paper, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to
formulate the adaptive traffic signal control problems. The proposed algorithm is
evaluated in the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulation platform, using a
real-world complex traffic network extracted from Montgomery County, Maryland.
Experiment results demonstrate that the robustness, optimality, and scalability of the
proposed MADDPG algorithm, which outperformed other state-of-the-art benchmark
algorithms.
There are still some limitations for real-world implementation of the proposed
algorithm. First, different definitions in formulating the reward functions and state
17

characteristics could significantly affect the control outcomes. Furthermore, the state
representation can be in a high dimensional space, especially when dynamic traffic
conditions are used as part of the state representation. In this case, the neural network will
require more training data samples and become more difficult to converge. Therefore,
how to learn efficiently (e.g., learning from limited data samples, efficient explorationexploitation, etc.) is a critical question in the application of RL in traffic signal control.
