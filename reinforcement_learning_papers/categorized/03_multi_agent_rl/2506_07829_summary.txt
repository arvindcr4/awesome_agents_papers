**PAPER:** Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information
**TITLE:** Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information
**ARXIV_ID:** 2506.07829v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a method to decentralize multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by incorporating temporal causal information into the learning process. The authors introduce a framework that enables agents to learn decentralized policies while ensuring the satisfaction of a global team task. The approach leverages temporal logic-based causal diagrams (TL-CDs) to model the causal relationships between events in the environment and incorporates this knowledge into the reward machines that guide the agents' behavior.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a novel approach to decentralize MARL by incorporating temporal causal information into the learning process.
* They introduce a framework that enables agents to learn decentralized policies while ensuring the satisfaction of a global team task.
* The approach leverages TL-CDs to model the causal relationships between events in the environment and incorporates this knowledge into the reward machines that guide the agents' behavior.
* The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through case studies, including the Generator Task, Laboratory Task, and Buttons Task.
* They provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of their approach, including the relaxed decomposition criterion and the compatibility of the relaxed and strict decomposition criteria.
