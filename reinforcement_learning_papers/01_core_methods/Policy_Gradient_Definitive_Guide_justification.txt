Abstract Snippet:
arXiv:2401.13662v2 [cs.LG] 1 Mar 2024  The Definitive Guide to Policy Gradients in Deep Reinforcement Learning: Theory, Algorithms and Implementations  Matthias Lehmann University of Cologne  A BSTRACT In recent years, various powerful policy gradient algorithms have been proposed in deep reinforcement learning. While all these algorithms build on the Policy Gradient Theorem, the specific design choices differ significantly across algorithms. We provide a holistic overview of on-policy policy gradient algorithms to facilitate the understanding of both their theoretical foundations and their pr...
