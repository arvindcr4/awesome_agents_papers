**TITLE**: Enhancing the Robustness of QMIX against State-adversarial Attacks
**ARXIV_ID**: 2307.00907v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 02_rlhf_alignment (RLHF Alignment)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper proposes four techniques to improve the robustness of QMIX, a popular cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, against state-adversarial attacks. The techniques are: (1) Gradient-based Adversary, (2) Policy Regularization, (3) Alternating Training with Learned Adversaries (ATLA), and (4) Policy Adversarial Actor Director (PA-AD).
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* The paper introduces four techniques to enhance the robustness of QMIX against state-adversarial attacks.
* It provides a theoretical foundation for these methods in the multi-agent setting.
* The paper evaluates the effectiveness of these techniques through experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment.
* It compares the pros and cons of each technique in terms of training difficulty and magnitude of enhancements.
* The paper concludes that PA-AD is a promising approach that overcomes the drawbacks of ATLA and gradient-based approaches, addressing the issue of computational complexity and offering the best guidance for optimization approaches.
