Abstract Snippet:
Structured Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Decision-Making  arXiv:2505.19053v2 [cs.LG] 27 Oct 2025  Heiko Hoppe1  Léo Baty2 Louis Bouvier2 Axel Parmentier2 Maximilian Schiffer1 1 Technical University of Munich 2 École des Ponts {heiko.hoppe,schiffer}@tum.de {leo.baty,louis.bouvier,axel.parmentier}@enpc.fr  Abstract Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly applied to real-world problems involving complex and structured decisions, such as routing, scheduling, and assortment planning. These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit str...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "These settings challenge standard RL algorithms, which struggle to scale, generalize, and exploit structure in the presence of combinatorial action spaces."
- "We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a novel actor-critic paradigm that embeds combinatorial optimization-layers into the actor neural network."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
