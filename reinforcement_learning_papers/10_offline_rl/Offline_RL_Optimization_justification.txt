Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025  OGB ENCH : B ENCHMARKING O FFLINE G OAL -C ONDITIONED RL Seohong Park1 Kevin Frans1 Benjamin Eysenbach2 1 University of California, Berkeley 2 Princeton University seohong@berkeley.edu  Sergey Levine1  arXiv:2410.20092v2 [cs.LG] 13 Feb 2025  A BSTRACT Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a major problem in reinforcement learning (RL) because it provides a simple, unsupervised, and domainagnostic way to acquire diverse behaviors and representations from unlabeled data without rewards."
- "Despite the importance of this setting, we lack a standard benchmark that can systematically evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 10_offline_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as offline, batch, dataset, matching the research direction's core themes.
