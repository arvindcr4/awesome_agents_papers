**TITLE:** Privacy-Engineered Value Decomposition Networks for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2311.06255v1

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a new algorithm called Privacy-Engineered Value Decomposition Networks (PE-VDN) for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. PE-VDN is designed to protect the confidentiality of agents' environment interaction data while still achieving good performance. The algorithm uses three privacy-engineering techniques: decentralized training, privacy-preserving multi-party summation, and training with differential privacy.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Decentralized training: PE-VDN allows agents to maintain and train their own neural network branches without sharing environment interaction data.
* Privacy-preserving multi-party summation: PE-VDN uses a secret sharing technique to compute the summation of agents' neural network outputs without revealing their individual outputs.
* Training with differential privacy: PE-VDN uses the DP-SGD algorithm to train neural networks with differential privacy, which protects the confidentiality of agents' environment interaction data.
* Theoretical analysis: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of PE-VDN's differential privacy level using the Moments Accountant method.
