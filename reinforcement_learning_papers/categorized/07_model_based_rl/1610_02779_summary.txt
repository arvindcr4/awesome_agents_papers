TITLE: Atomic size zone interaction potential between two ground-state cold atoms
ARXIV_ID: Not provided
RESEARCH_METHOD: 07_model_based_rl 
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The paper uses the complex-source-point model to deduce the interaction potential equation for the separation R between two atoms, which is comparable with the size of the atoms. The method is based on the vacuum spatial correlations, where the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce instantaneous correlated dipole moments on the two atoms.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
- The paper introduces the complex-source-point model to study the interaction potential between two atoms at distances comparable to the atomic size.
- The model removes the singular point at R=0, allowing for the calculation of the interaction potential at small distances.
- The numerical calculation shows that the interaction potential exhibits different behaviors at different distances, including strong attractive and repulsive forces, and electromagnetic forces similar to van der Waals forces.
- The paper suggests that the complex-source-point model may be used to unify the strong and electromagnetic forces.
- The authors provide numerical calculations and figures to illustrate the interaction potential and its characteristics.
