Abstract Snippet:
arXiv:2301.10505v1 [math.CA] 25 Jan 2023  Asymptotically uniform functions: a single hypothesis which solves two old problems Jean–Pierre Gabriel∗ and Jean–Paul Berrut∗ January 26, 2023  Abstract The asymptotic study of a time-dependent function f as the solution of a differential equation often leads to the question of whether its derivative f˙ vanishes at infinity. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for this is that f˙ is what may be called asymptotically uniform. We generalize the result to higher order derivatives. We further show that the same property for f itself is also ...
