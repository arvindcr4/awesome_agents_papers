Reinforcement Learning Enhanced LLMs: A Survey Shuhe Wang♠ , Shengyu Zhang♣ , Jie Zhang⋆ , Runyi Hu▲ , Xiaoya Li♦ Tianwei Zhang▲ , Jiwei Li♣ , Fei Wu♣ , Guoyin Wang, Eduard Hovy♠  Abstract  arXiv:2412.10400v3 [cs.CL] 24 Feb 2025  Reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced large language models (LLMs), particularly exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have exhibited outstanding performance. Depsite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its implementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward modeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses challenges fo...
