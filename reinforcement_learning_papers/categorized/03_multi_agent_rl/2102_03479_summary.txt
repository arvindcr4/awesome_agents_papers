**TITLE:** Rethinking the Implementation Tricks and Monotonicity Constraint in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2102.03479v19
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper investigates the influence of certain code-level optimizations on the performance of QMIX, a popular multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. The authors also explore the effects of the monotonicity constraint on the algorithm's performance. They propose a new algorithm, RIIT, which uses a monotonic mixing network as a critic network, and demonstrate its effectiveness in various cooperative multi-agent tasks.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper provides a thorough analysis of the code-level optimizations used in QMIX and their impact on the algorithm's performance.
* The authors propose a new algorithm, RIIT, which uses a monotonic mixing network as a critic network, and demonstrate its effectiveness in various cooperative multi-agent tasks.
* The paper explores the effects of the monotonicity constraint on the algorithm's performance and provides insights into its importance in cooperative multi-agent learning.
* The authors compare the performance of QMIX and its variants, including Qatten, QPLEX, WQMIX, and LICA, and provide a ranking of their strength in terms of monotonicity constraints.
