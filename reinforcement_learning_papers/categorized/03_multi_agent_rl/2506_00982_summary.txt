**TITLE:** Robust and Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Communication for Autonomous Vehicles: From Simulation to Hardware
**ARXIV_ID:** 2506.00982v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel framework called RSR-RSMARL, which enables robust and safe multi-agent reinforcement learning for connected autonomous vehicles. The framework incorporates real-world constraints into the simulation-based MARL problem formulation and training process, ensuring zero-shot transfer of trained policies to physical testbeds. The approach aligns state and action spaces with real-world sensing and actuation capabilities, incorporates communication delays into the training loop, and enforces safety through a CBF-based Safety Shield.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Proposes a novel RSR-RSMARL framework for robust and safe multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication for autonomous vehicles.
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in both simulation and real-world experiments using 1/10th-scale autonomous vehicles.
* Shows that the integration of the Safety Shield and inter-agent communication significantly reduces collision risk and improves coordination among agents.
* Highlights the importance of robust state and action representations in enabling scalable and generalizable Sim2Real transfer for multi-agent autonomous vehicle systems.
