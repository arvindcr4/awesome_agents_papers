**PAPER:** Instance-Level Generation for Representation Learning
**TITLE:** Instance-Level Generation for Representation Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2510.09171v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a novel approach to training instance-level recognition (ILR) models using generative diffusion models to automatically create diverse, instance-specific training images. The method eliminates the need for extensive data collection and curation, opening up new opportunities to easily train ILR models across various domains.
