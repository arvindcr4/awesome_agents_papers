Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Arık3 , Dong Wang1 , Hamed Zamani2 , Jiawei Han1 1 Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 2 Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval, University of Massachusetts Amherst 3 Google Cloud AI Research {bowenj4,zhenrui3,dwang24,hanj}@illinois.edu, {hzeng, zamani}@cs.umass.edu {jinsungyoon,soarik}@google.com  Abstract Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs)."
- "Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 09_agentic_rl because it explicitly discusses concepts such as agent, tool, web, matching the research direction's core themes.
