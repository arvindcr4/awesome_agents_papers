TITLE: Human-compatible driving partners through data-regularized self-play reinforcement learning
ARXIV_ID: 2403.19648v2
RESEARCH_METHOD: 02_rlhf_alignment

METHOD_DESCRIPTION: The paper proposes Human-Regularized PPO (HR-PPO), a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that combines self-play with a regularization term to nudge agents towards human-like driving behavior. The algorithm uses a small penalty for deviating from a human reference policy, which is trained on a dataset of human driving demonstrations.

KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* The paper introduces HR-PPO, a new multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that combines self-play with a regularization term to encourage human-like driving behavior.
* The algorithm is evaluated on a large set of multi-agent traffic scenarios and shows improved performance in terms of goal rate, off-road rate, and collision rate compared to baseline methods.
* The paper demonstrates that HR-PPO agents can generalize to unseen human drivers and scenarios, and that they can coordinate with human drivers in interactive scenarios.
* The algorithm is shown to be effective in achieving human-like driving behavior, with a Goal-Conditioned Average Displacement Error (GC-ADE) of 0.54, which is a 60% improvement over the baseline PPO method.
