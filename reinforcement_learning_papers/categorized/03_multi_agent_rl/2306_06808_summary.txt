TITLE: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Guided by Signal Temporal Logic Specifications
ARXIV_ID: 2306.06808v2
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework guided by Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. STL is a formal language that provides a principled and expressive way to describe requirements, including both task specifications and safety specifications. The framework uses the robustness values of STL specifications as rewards to guide the learning process, ensuring that the agents learn policies that satisfy the desired specifications. The authors also introduce an STL safety shield to guarantee the satisfaction of hard safety requirements.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* A novel MARL framework guided by STL specifications, which provides a principled and expressive way to describe requirements.
* The use of robustness values of STL specifications as rewards to guide the learning process.
* The introduction of an STL safety shield to guarantee the satisfaction of hard safety requirements.
* Empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning better policies with higher average rewards and ensuring system safety.
* The application of the framework to various testbeds, including multi-agent particle-world environment (MPE) and CARLA, with promising results.
