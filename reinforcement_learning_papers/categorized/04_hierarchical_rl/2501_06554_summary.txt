**TITLE:** Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Agent Grouping in Cooperative Systems
**ARXIV_ID:** 2501.06554v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 04_hierarchical_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** 
This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) approach for optimal agent grouping in cooperative systems. The method involves distinguishing between high-level decisions of grouping and low-level agents' actions, utilizing the CTDE (Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution) paradigm for efficient learning and scalable execution. Permutation-invariant neural networks are employed to handle homogeneity and cooperation among agents, and the option-critic algorithm is adapted for hierarchical decision-making.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
- A hierarchical RL framework for simultaneous learning of optimal grouping and agent policy
- Employment of CTDE paradigm for efficient learning and scalable execution
- Utilization of permutation-invariant neural networks for handling homogeneity and cooperation among agents
- Adaptation of the option-critic algorithm for managing hierarchical decision-making
- Proposal of a Deep Set architecture for both policy and critic networks to ensure permutation invariance and scalability.
