Abstract Snippet:
EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies  arXiv:2507.07986v2 [cs.LG] 15 Jul 2025  Perry Dong Stanford University  Qiyang Li UC Berkeley  Dorsa Sadigh Stanford University  Chelsea Finn Stanford University  A BSTRACT We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies ...
