**TITLE:** Networked Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Emergent Communication
**ARXIV_ID:** 2004.02780v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper formulates a networked multi-agent reinforcement learning problem where cooperative agents communicate with each other using an emergent language. The agents are connected via a fixed underlying network and can communicate along the edges of this network by exchanging discrete symbols. The paper proposes a method for training these agents using emergent communication and demonstrates its applicability to the problem of managing traffic controllers.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* Formulation of a networked multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with emergent communication
* Proposal of a method for training agents using emergent communication
* Demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed approach using traffic management as a case study
* Analysis of the emergent communication to show its utility, grounding, and relationship with the underlying network topology
* Experimental evaluation of the proposed approach on two different road networks, including a 10-agent network and a 28-agent network.
