**TITLE:** A Survey of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 02_rlhf_alignment
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a variant of reinforcement learning that learns from human feedback instead of relying on an engineered reward function. RLHF allows humans to define and iteratively refine objectives during training, enhancing alignment between agent behavior and human values and objectives.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* RLHF has seen successful applications in various domains, including large language model fine-tuning, image generation, music generation, continuous control, games, and robotics.
* Methodological advances have emerged, such as fusing multiple feedback types, enhancing query efficiency through active learning and query synthesis, incorporating psychological insights to improve feedback quality, using techniques like meta-learning to quickly adapt learned preferences to new tasks, and using available preference data more efficiently through approaches like data augmentation and semi-supervised learning.
* Novel theoretical results have provided insights and new questions about the fundamental mathematical problems underlying RLHF.
* RLHF has the potential to address safety issues arising from misaligned rewards and enhance the performance and adaptability of intelligent systems.
