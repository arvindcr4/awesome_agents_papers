    "prompt": "Create a flowchart diagram showing Iterative Reasoning Preference Optimization (IRPO).\n\nInclude these key elements:\n- Initial query: User question or problem\n- Generate multiple reasoning traces: Create diverse reasoning paths\n- Evaluate and rank: Use preference model to judge quality\n- Preference learning: Update model based on preferences\n- Iterative refinement: Multiple rounds of improvement\n- Final optimized response: Best reasoning chain\n\nUse a spiral or cyclical design showing iteration. Purple for generation, orange for evaluation, green for refinement. Show quality improvement across iterations."
