**PAPER:** Learning to Communicate with Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Learning to Communicate with Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1605.06676v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes two approaches for learning communication protocols in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings: Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning (DIAL). RIAL uses deep Q-learning with a recurrent network to address partial observability, while DIAL allows real-valued messages to pass between agents during centralized learning, enabling end-to-end training across agents.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of RIAL and DIAL as two approaches for learning communication protocols in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings.
* Demonstration of the effectiveness of DIAL in learning communication protocols in complex environments, such as the Switch Riddle and MNIST games.
* Analysis of the importance of channel noise in regularizing the communication channel and preventing over-encoding of information.
* Comparison of RIAL and DIAL with and without parameter sharing, and evaluation of their performance in different tasks.
* Discussion of the potential applications and future directions of this research, including the use of deep learning approaches to study communication and language.
