**TITLE:** An Algorithm for Adversary Aware Decentralized Networked MARL
**ARXIV_ID:** 2305.05573v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes an algorithm for decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that is aware of adversarial agents in the network. The algorithm is based on a consensus-based approach, where agents share their local parameters with their neighbors to reach a consensus. The authors modify the existing consensus-based MARL algorithm to incorporate coordinated responses by regular nodes in the presence of adversaries.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**

* The paper proposes an algorithm for decentralized MARL that is robust to adversarial agents.
* The algorithm is based on a consensus-based approach, where agents share their local parameters with their neighbors.
* The authors modify the existing consensus-based MARL algorithm to incorporate coordinated responses by regular nodes in the presence of adversaries.
* The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness through simulations.
* The algorithm is fully decentralized, meaning that each agent only needs to communicate with its neighbors, and does not require any centralized training or control.
