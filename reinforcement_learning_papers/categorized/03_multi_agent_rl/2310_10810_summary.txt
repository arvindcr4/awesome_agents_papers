**Paper:** Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Adversarial Regularization: Theoretical Foundation and Stable Algorithms
**Title:** Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Adversarial Regularization
**ArXiv ID:** 2310.10810v1
**Research Method:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**Method Description:** The paper proposes a new framework called ERNIE (adversarially Regularized multiageNt reInforcement lEarning) for robust multi-agent reinforcement learning. ERNIE uses adversarial regularization to promote smoothness in policies, which leads to improved robustness against changing transition dynamics, observation noise, and malicious actions of agents.
**Key Contributions:**

* Theoretical foundation for robust multi-agent reinforcement learning
* Proposal of ERNIE framework for robust multi-agent reinforcement learning
* Experimental evaluation of ERNIE on various environments, including traffic light control and particle environments
* Extension of ERNIE to mean-field multi-agent reinforcement learning
* Comparison with baseline algorithms, including QCOMBO, MADDPG, and COMA.
