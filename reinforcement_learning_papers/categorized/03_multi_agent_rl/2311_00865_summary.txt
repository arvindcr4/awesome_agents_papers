**PAPER:** Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**TITLE:** Selectively Sharing Experiences Improves Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 2311.00865v2 [cs.LG]
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach called Selective Multi-Agent Prioritized Experience Relay (SUPER). SUPER allows agents to share a limited number of transitions they observe during training, which can help each agent learn faster. The approach is based on the idea that not all experiences are equally relevant, and selectively sharing the most relevant ones can improve learning.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper introduces the SUPER approach, which enables agents to share a limited number of transitions during training.
* The authors evaluate SUPER on several multi-agent benchmark domains and show that it outperforms baseline approaches, including decentralized training and state-of-the-art multi-agent RL algorithms.
* The paper provides an analysis of the performance of SUPER under different experience selection criteria and target bandwidths.
* The authors discuss the implications of their results and suggest potential avenues for future work, including the application of SUPER to other off-policy RL algorithms and the exploration of different experience selection heuristics.
