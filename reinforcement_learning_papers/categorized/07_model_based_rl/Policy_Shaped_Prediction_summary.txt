**TITLE:** Policy-shaped prediction: avoiding distractions in model-based reinforcement learning
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces a new method called Policy-Shaped Prediction (PSP) that focuses the capacity of an agent's world model on aspects of the environment that are useful to its policy. PSP combines three ideas: (1) using the gradient of the policy with respect to the input image to identify pixels that influence the policy, (2) aggregating the importance of individual pixels by object using a segmentation model, and (3) removing wasteful encoding of the preceding action in the image embedding using an adversarial prediction head.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The paper introduces the Policy-Shaped Prediction (PSP) method, which achieves strong distraction suppression by combining gradient-based loss weighting with a pre-trained segmentation model.
* PSP outperforms other approaches designed to reduce the impact of distractors and achieves a 2x improvement in robustness against challenging distractions.
* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of PSP in various environments, including the Reafferent Deepmind Control environment and the Distracting Control Suite.
* The authors investigate the importance of each component of the PSP method through ablation studies and find that combining segmentation, policy gradient sensory weighting, and adversarial action prediction results in the best scores across different environments.
