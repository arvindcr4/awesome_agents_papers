**TITLE**: MARLIM: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Management
**ARXIV_ID**: 2308.01649v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD**: 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION**: This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework called MARLIM to address the inventory management problem for a single-echelon multi-products supply chain with stochastic demands and lead-times. The framework uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to model the interactions between different products and optimize the inventory management decisions.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS**:
* Develops a novel reinforcement learning framework for inventory management
* Uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to model interactions between products
* Optimizes inventory management decisions for a single-echelon multi-products supply chain
* Demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework through numerical experiments on real data
* Shows that the framework can outperform traditional baselines such as MinMax and Oracle agents
