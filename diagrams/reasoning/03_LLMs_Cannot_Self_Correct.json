    "prompt": "Create a flowchart diagram showing the limitations of self-correction in LLMs.\n\nInclude these key elements:\n- Initial incorrect response generation\n- Self-evaluation attempt: Model tries to detect its own error\n- Feedback loop: Model attempts to correct itself\n- Failure modes: Show why self-correction often fails (reinforcement of errors, lack of external ground truth)\n- Final output: Often still incorrect or worse\n\nUse a red/orange color scheme to highlight limitations. Show the cycle of attempted correction and potential failure points."
