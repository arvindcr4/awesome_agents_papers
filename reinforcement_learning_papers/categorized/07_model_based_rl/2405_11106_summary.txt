**TITLE:** LLM-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Current and Future Directions
**ARXIV_ID:** 2405.11106v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper discusses the current state and future directions of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). It surveys existing LLM-based MARL frameworks and provides potential research directions for future work.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Surveys existing LLM-based MARL frameworks
* Discusses the potential of LLM-based MARL for cooperative tasks and human-in/on-the-loop scenarios
* Identifies research directions for future work, including personality-enabled cooperation, language-enabled human-in/on-the-loop frameworks, traditional MARL and LLM co-design, and safety and security in MAS
