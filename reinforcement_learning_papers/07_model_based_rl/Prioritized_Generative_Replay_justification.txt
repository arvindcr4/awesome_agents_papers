Abstract Snippet:
TO APPEAR IN IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMETRICS, IDENTITY AND BEHAVIOR (T-BIOM)  1  CATFace: Cross-Attribute-Guided Transformer with Self-Attention Distillation for Low-Quality Face Recognition  arXiv:2401.03037v1 [cs.CV] 5 Jan 2024  Niloufar Alipour Talemi , Hossein Kashiani , and Nasser M. Nasrabadi , Fellow, IEEE Abstract—Although face recognition (FR) has achieved great success in recent years, it is still challenging to accurately recognize faces in low-quality images due to the obscured facial details. Nevertheless, it is often feasible to make predictions about specific soft biometric (SB)...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
