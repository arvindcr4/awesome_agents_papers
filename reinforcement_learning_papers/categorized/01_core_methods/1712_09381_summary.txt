**TITLE:** RLlib: Abstractions for Distributed Reinforcement Learning
**ARXIV_ID:** 1712.09381v4
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 01_core_methods
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper introduces RLlib, a library for distributed reinforcement learning that provides scalable software primitives for RL. It argues for distributing RL components in a composable way, adapting algorithms for top-down hierarchical control, and encapsulating parallelism and resource requirements within short-running compute tasks.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduces RLlib, a library for distributed reinforcement learning
* Proposes a hierarchical control model for distributed RL
* Demonstrates the benefits of this principle through RLlib, which provides scalable software primitives for RL
* Shows that RLlib's policy optimizers match or exceed the performance of implementations in specialized systems
* Evaluates the performance of RLlib on Evolution Strategies, Proximal Policy Optimization, and A3C, comparing against specialized systems built specifically for those algorithms.
