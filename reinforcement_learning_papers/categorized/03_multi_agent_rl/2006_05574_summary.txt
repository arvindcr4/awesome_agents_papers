**PAPER:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Realistic Limit Order Book Market Simulation
**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Realistic Limit Order Book Market Simulation
**ARXIV_ID:** 2006.05574v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to optimize execution strategies in a realistic limit order book market simulation. The authors use a Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) algorithm to train an agent to learn optimal execution strategies in a multi-agent environment.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to optimize execution strategies in a realistic limit order book market simulation.
* They develop a DDDL algorithm to train an agent to learn optimal execution strategies in a multi-agent environment.
* The authors evaluate the performance of their approach using a market replay simulation with real limit order book data.
* They compare the performance of their approach with a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy and show that their approach converges to the TWAP strategy in some scenarios.
* The authors also evaluate the realism of their simulation using limit order book stylized facts and show that their simulation is consistent with real market data.
