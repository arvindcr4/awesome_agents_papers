**TITLE:** Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative and Competitive Autonomous Vehicles using AutoDRIVE Ecosystem
**ARXIV_ID:** 2309.10007v2
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper presents a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for cooperative and competitive autonomous vehicles using the AutoDRIVE ecosystem. The framework enables the development of physically accurate and graphically realistic digital twins of autonomous vehicles, which can be used to train and deploy multi-agent reinforcement learning policies.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* Introduction of the AutoDRIVE ecosystem for developing digital twins of autonomous vehicles
* Development of a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for cooperative and competitive autonomous vehicles
* Application of the framework to two case studies: cooperative intersection traversal and competitive autonomous racing
* Evaluation of the framework's performance in both case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in training and deploying multi-agent policies.
