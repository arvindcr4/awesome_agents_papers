Abstract Snippet:
Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Action Spaces  Renhao Zhang * 1 Haotian Fu * 1 Yilin Miao 1 George Konidaris 1  arXiv:2404.03037v3 [cs.LG] 24 May 2024  Abstract  or Robot Soccer (Hausknecht & Stone, 2016b).  We propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm—Dynamics Learning and predictive control with Parameterized Actions (DLPA)—for Parameterized Action Markov Decision Processes (PAMDPs). The agent learns a parameterized-action-conditioned dynamics model and plans with a modified Model Predictive Path Integral control. We theoretically quantify the differen...

Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "We propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm—Dynamics Learning and predictive control with Parameterized Actions (DLPA)—for Parameterized Action Markov Decision Processes (PAMDPs)."
- "Our empirical results on several standard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic performance than state-of-the-art PAMDP methods.1  Compared to just discrete or continuous action space, Reinforcem"

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
