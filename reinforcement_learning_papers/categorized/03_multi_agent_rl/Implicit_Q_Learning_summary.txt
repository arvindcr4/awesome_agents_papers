TITLE: Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
RESEARCH_METHOD: 03_multi_agent_rl
METHOD_DESCRIPTION: QMIX is a novel value-based method that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. It employs a mixing network that estimates joint action-values as a monotonic combination of per-agent values, ensuring consistency between centralised and decentralised policies.
KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:
* QMIX can represent a richer class of action-value functions than existing methods like VDN.
* It learns a factored joint Q-function that can be easily decentralised, allowing for fully decentralised execution.
* QMIX outperforms existing multi-agent RL methods, including IQL, VDN, and COMA, on the challenging SMAC benchmark.
* The method is flexible and can be applied to various scenarios, including those with heterogeneous agents and large action spaces.
* QMIX's increased representational capacity allows it to learn more accurate Q-value estimates, leading to better performance in tasks that require coordinated teamwork.
