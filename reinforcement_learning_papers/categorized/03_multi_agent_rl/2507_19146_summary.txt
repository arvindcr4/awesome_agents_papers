**TITLE:** Diverse and Adaptive Behavior Curriculum for Autonomous Driving: A Student-Teacher Framework with Multi-Agent RL

**ARXIV_ID:** 2507.19146v1 [cs.RO]

**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 03_multi_agent_rl

**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** This paper proposes a student-teacher framework to improve the robustness of self-driving vehicles (SDVs) in dynamically generated traffic using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and automatic curriculum learning. The teacher adapts non-player characters' (NPCs) behavior, adjusting difficulty levels based on the student's performance. The framework consists of a graph-based MARL teacher and a student RL component, which are trained jointly in a shared environment.

**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* A novel MARL-based teacher capable of generating traffic behaviors with varying difficulty levels.
* An automatic curriculum algorithm that orchestrates the concurrent training of student and teacher components, creating an adaptive behavior curriculum.
* Evaluation of the proposed framework on unsignalized urban intersections, demonstrating the teacher's ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors and the student's improved generalizability and robustness.
* Comparison of the proposed framework with a baseline student trained in rule-based traffic, showing significant improvements in route progress, average driving velocity, and overall driving rewards.
