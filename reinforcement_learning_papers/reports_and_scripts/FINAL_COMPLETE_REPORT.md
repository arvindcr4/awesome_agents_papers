## Processing Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct Processing (201 papers)
Full paper analysis for papers <100KB

### Phase 2: Chunking Strategy (+34 papers)
Large papers (100-200KB) split into 3000-line chunks

### Phase 3: First-Chunk Strategy (+40 papers)
Abstract + introduction only (first 1000-1500 lines)

### Phase 4: Descriptive Papers (+61 papers)
Applied same strategies to papers with descriptive names

## Key Insights

### Research Trends (by paper count)
1. **Multi-Agent RL (48%)** - Dominant area, showing strong interest in multi-agent systems
2. **RLHF/Alignment (29%)** - Major focus on aligning models with human feedback
3. **Model-Based RL (14%)** - Significant research on planning and world models

### Success Factors
- Arxiv-numbered papers had 99.3% success rate
- Descriptive papers had lower success (73%) due to naming variations
- Three-phase strategy handled context window limitations effectively
