**Paper:** Lagrangian irreversibility and energy exchanges in rotating-stratified turbulent flows
**Title:** Lagrangian irreversibility and energy exchanges in rotating-stratified turbulent flows
**ARXIV_ID:** 2401.14779v1
**RESEARCH_METHOD:** 07_model_based_rl (Note: This is not explicitly stated in the text, but based on the content, it appears to be a model-based research method)
**METHOD_DESCRIPTION:** The paper studies the interaction between kinetic and potential energy in rotating-stratified turbulent flows using direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations. The authors investigate the energy budget for such flows and establish a connection with the Karman-Howarth-Monin relations in the Lagrangian framework.
**KEY_CONTRIBUTIONS:**
* The authors investigate the interaction between kinetic and potential energy in rotating-stratified turbulent flows.
* They establish a connection with the Karman-Howarth-Monin relations in the Lagrangian framework.
* The paper provides a detailed analysis of the energy budget for rotating-stratified turbulent flows.
* The authors identify a characteristic length scale ℓt that marks the transition between a direct and inverse energy cascade.
* The paper discusses the implications of the results for understanding the dynamics of rotating-stratified turbulent flows.
