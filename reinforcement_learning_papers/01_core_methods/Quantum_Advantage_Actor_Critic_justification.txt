Specific Evidence for Classification:
- "Quantum Advantage Actor-Critic for Reinforcement Learning Michael Kölle1∗ , Mohamad Hgog1∗ , Fabian Ritz1 , Philipp Altmann1 , Maximilian Zorn1 , Jonas Stein1 and Claudia Linnhoff-Popien1 1 Institute of Informatics, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany  arXiv:2401.07043v1 [quant-ph] 13 Jan 2024  michael.koelle@ifi.lmu.de  Keywords:  Quantum Computing, Quantum Reinforcement Learning, Advantage Actor-Critic  Abstract:  Quantum computing offers efficient encapsulation of high-dimensional states."
- "In this work, we propose a novel quantum reinforcement learning approach that combines the Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm with variational quantum circuits by substituting parts of the classical components."

Conclusion:
This paper is classified as 01_core_methods because it explicitly discusses concepts such as algorithm, policy gradient, q-learning, matching the research direction's core themes.
